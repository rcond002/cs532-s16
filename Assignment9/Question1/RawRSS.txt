But as the second of these albums, 1964\'s &lt;i&gt;JuJu&lt;/i&gt;, clearly demonstrates, Shorter was far more than a mere imitator; yes, his and the group\'s playing often recalls the exploratory spirit of where Coltrane was at then, what with Shorter\'s zig-zagging sax lines and Elvin Jones\' rumbling, otherworldly percussion, but his six compositions here are just as challenging, ambitious and surprising as any of Trane\'s stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most notably, the opening title track is flecked by more than a hint of African music, as Shorter himself acknowledged in the album\'s liner notes, and "House of Jade" has an unmistakable oriental flavor. All six pieces that the formidably strong quartet runs through, from "JuJu" to "Twelve More Bars to Go", are filled with unpredictable twists and turns, and unique melodic phrases. Shorter played with well-established giants like Miles Davis and Coltrane in the 60\'s, and like many others who played with them in their early careers, he no doubt suffered early on when first beginning to present himself as a leading creative force on his own, but if his previous album (1963\'s &lt;i&gt;Night Dreamer&lt;/i&gt; set) didn\'t make the case for him as such, then &lt;i&gt;JuJu&lt;/i&gt; certainly did. Moreover, he would only continue to expand and improve on his own highly unusual skills for composition by leaps and bounds over the next several years, and although it isn\'t as if his previous recordings were inferior, it was &lt;i&gt;JuJu &lt;/i&gt;that undoubtedly set in motion a string of high-quality recordings that would continue until the end of the decade.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2016/03/wayne-shorter-juju-1964.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uIX0lMuVc-M/VuN2CPKjCdI/AAAAAAAABSQ/kHSG_B3EqwUVkmsccfReS3YPPyWMKd1FA/s72-c/MI0001670468.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1534533159025955683</guid><pubdate>Wed, 03 Feb 2016 07:04:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2016-02-02T23:16:49.633-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pavement "Wowee Zowee" (1995)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wi3PGhhvk6s/VrGbVuWCVMI/AAAAAAAABPs/Z0CyNX1MbPE/s1600/MI0002036632.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wi3PGhhvk6s/VrGbVuWCVMI/AAAAAAAABPs/Z0CyNX1MbPE/s320/MI0002036632.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With wry, hooky singles like "Cut Your Hair", "Gold Soundz" and "Range Life", 1994\'s &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain &lt;/i&gt;brought Pavement a small measure of unexpected commercial recognition, matched by the critical appraisal and indie-world popularity that they\'d earned well with two of the best, most distinctive rock records of the 90\'s, or any era really. But despite the increased attention, the group would deftly retain their position as the premier act of an increasingly distinct "indie rock" underground, one that was distancing itself more with each passing year from the now-mainstream, far more palatable "alt-rock" of Stone Temple Pilots (heh heh), Smashing Pumpkins (ha! ha!) or Pearl Jam. And without really having to &lt;i&gt;try&lt;/i&gt;, no less; no matter how much more accessible and conventionally structured the tunes on &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain&lt;/i&gt; were compared to the fractured, lo-fi &lt;i&gt;Slanted and Enchanted&lt;/i&gt;, Pavement were still far too weird and adventuresome to fit comfortably into the post-Nirvana modern-rock landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remaining on the legendary Matador Records, they followed the effervescently melodic &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain&lt;/i&gt; with a sprawling, disjointed, weary double-album in the form of 1995\'s &lt;i&gt;Wowee Zowee&lt;/i&gt;, which, with little bits of various musical styles sprinkled liberally across eighteen songs, has often been likened to The Beatles\' &lt;i&gt;White Album&lt;/i&gt;. When you get inside of it, though, it\'s not really all that similar to The Beatles\' famously chaotic work. (And not just because it\'s actually a much shorter album; if you have the album on vinyl, it might be the only double-LP in your collection in which the album contained is too long to fit on two sides, but not long enough to spread across four.) Sure, Pavement is expanding their musical range here, opening with the surprisingly vulnerable, introspective singer-songwriterism of "We Dance", which was apparently influenced directly by Britpop contemporaries "The London" Suede , and also channels a bit of the late, great David Bowie as heard on &lt;i&gt;Hunky Dory&lt;/i&gt;; it appropriately features Stephen Malkmus affecting something of a British accent. "Range Life" certainly brought country music, or country-rock to mind, but "Father to a Sister of Thought" actually has a pedal-steel guitar part straight out of The Byrds\' &lt;i&gt;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&lt;/i&gt;. The sublime "Grave Architecture" is flecked by 60\'s pop, the lumbering "Half a Canyon" by both blues-rock &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; Krautrock, and the raucous minute-long "Serpentine Pad" sounds like a lost Sex Pistols track rewritten by a pissed-off university student railing against "this corporation attitude!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unlike &lt;i&gt;The White Album&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wowee Zowee&lt;/i&gt;\'s songs don\'t shapeshift from one to another, and you get no sense that the group was in disarray during its recording, or that it feels at any time like a compilation of each band member\'s prospective solo efforts. Pavement here sound more like a group that\'s confident enough at this point to start really expanding their musical vocabulary, and even though it features various styles that Pavement had never really played with before, &lt;i&gt;Wowee Zowee&lt;/i&gt; ultimately plays like something of a careening, egg-scrambled mix of their first two albums: reflecting the melodies and exquisite songcraft of &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain&lt;/i&gt; with outstanding numbers like "Rattled By the Rush", "Black Out", "Grounded" and "Motion Suggests", but also marking a return to the willfully obscure, esoteric, experimental proclivities that marked their earliest recordings, with offbeat detours like Scott Kannberg\'s closing "Western Homes" and the funky "Brinx Job". Their third album is certainly not as strong as its two predecessors, but its playful, limitless feel only served to confirm Pavement\'s standing as one of the very best and most surprising rock bands of their time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2016/02/pavement-wowee-zowee-1995.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wi3PGhhvk6s/VrGbVuWCVMI/AAAAAAAABPs/Z0CyNX1MbPE/s72-c/MI0002036632.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2072266526809437364</guid><pubdate>Tue, 26 Jan 2016 20:07:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2016-01-26T12:07:49.324-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pixies "Trompe le Monde" (1991)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-62kKuzv8dck/VbiD5DY1h2I/AAAAAAAAA3E/vy4aEV090qs/s1600/MI0002447612.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-62kKuzv8dck/VbiD5DY1h2I/AAAAAAAAA3E/vy4aEV090qs/s320/MI0002447612.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Tensions in the Pixies camp had already reached critical mass before they entered the studio to record what would end up being their last album for over two decades, 1991\'s &lt;i&gt;Trompe le Monde&lt;/i&gt;. In English, this means "fool the world", and that might just be the reason it compelled one writer (namely, Michael Bonner of Lime Lizard) to dub it "one of the best albums you may very well ever hear" and "a strong contender for best album of the 20th century". To each their own, but it\'s quite bizarre praise, on account of how even among diehard Pixies fanatics, their then-swan song was commonly regarded as their weakest album; "was" regarded, because 2014\'s absurdly belabored "comeback" album &lt;i&gt;Indie Cindy&lt;/i&gt;, comprised entirely of material which had already been released over three EP\'s to much critical disdain, must surely take the cake as &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;turkey in the group\'s relatively small body of work. But nonetheless, &lt;i&gt;Trompe le Monde&lt;/i&gt; is still most definitely the least-compelling and most inconsistent of their four original studio albums with Kim Deal in the lineup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She may have still been in the band and playing her bass like a champ, but just like its predecessor &lt;i&gt;Bossanova&lt;/i&gt;, it contains no songs written by her or lead vocal spots, and close to none of her backing vocals. You\'d hardly believe she was even there with the rest of them. This isn\'t at all the reason why it\'s not as impressive as the three previous records, or even the debut EP &lt;i&gt;Come on Pilgrim&lt;/i&gt;, especially since by this time Kim was already preoccupied as the dominant singer and songwriter in her own band (The Breeders), but it did lead yet another writer to quip that this gives it the feel of being Black Francis\' first solo album rather than a band effort. His fascination with science fiction takes center stage in the songs\' lyrics, as opposed to the lurid sexual and religious elements of earlier albums. In addition, after the surfy, spacey sound of &lt;i&gt;Bossanova&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Trompe &lt;/i&gt;is by comparison a harder-rocking, more straightforward affair, a shift which was apparently motivated by the presence of Ozzy Osbourne recording in a different part of the studio they were working in at the same time. This does not, however, signal a whole-hearted return to the sheet-metal abrasion of &lt;i&gt;Surfer Rosa&lt;/i&gt;, or the short, sharp, lethal tunesmithing of &lt;i&gt;Doolittle&lt;/i&gt;. Although the group are augmented on several songs by the swirling keyboards of former Captain Beefheart sideman and Pere Ubu member Eric Drew Feldman, they often sound like a more conventional "college rock", or even hard-rock band than ever before, even on great songs like the swaggering, nasty "U-Mass".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of these things are what make &lt;i&gt;Trompe le Monde&lt;/i&gt; a lesser album than its predecessors, nor do they make it an out-and-out &lt;i&gt;bad&lt;/i&gt; album at all, but they are worth noting when considering why it is what it is. Now, it\'s down to the strength of the songs themselves, which (just like &lt;i&gt;Bossanova&lt;/i&gt;, as a matter of fact) is pretty high for the material that makes up its first half, like the raw, abrasive "Planet of Sound"; the quirky single "Alec Eiffel", which was moderately successful on the modern rock chart; an explosive cover of The Jesus and Mary Chain\'s "Head On"; "The Sad Punk", which puts a whole new spin on their famous \'loud/quiet/loud\' dynamics, alternating between the full-bore hardcore punk of its verses and its sweet, melancholic choruses; and "U-Mass", with Francis\' hilarious-yet-acidic, screamed refrain of "It\'s EDUCATIONAAAAL!" Like its predecessor, the quality of its material runs out of steam during its second half, drawing to a close with decidedly unremarkable songs like "Lovely Day", "Motorway to Roswell" and "Navajo Know".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the day, it was a pretty good way to go out for the Pixies, wrapping up their initial run after just four LP\'s and before they might\'ve stumbled even worse on a follow-up album at a time when their members (especially Deal and Francis, of course) weren\'t really getting along anymore. The only thing you can really say is a shame about the way the Pixies initially broke up is that they disbanded just before they almost certainly would\'ve been able to bask rightfully in the glow of the alternative rock bonanza of the early-mid 90\'s, which ironically would be kick-started by a song that Kurt Cobain admitted was an attempt to "rip off the Pixies".</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2016/01/pixies-trompe-le-monde-1991.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-62kKuzv8dck/VbiD5DY1h2I/AAAAAAAAA3E/vy4aEV090qs/s72-c/MI0002447612.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5099004870408469066</guid><pubdate>Fri, 08 Jan 2016 00:40:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2016-01-07T16:40:12.193-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Smiths "Meat is Murder" (1985)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLGir5eez58/Vo7xYjKetsI/AAAAAAAABOs/dFN_KejK4hE/s1600/MeatMurder.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLGir5eez58/Vo7xYjKetsI/AAAAAAAABOs/dFN_KejK4hE/s1600/MeatMurder.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;As unexpected as it was, it didn\'t take long for The Smiths to rise to fame in Britain; though "Hand in Glove", their debut single, made little impact when it was first released in mid-1983, it only took them a now-legendary appearance on Top of the Pops six months later to make the band and their leader Morrissey into the nation\'s newest, most unlikely pop stars. Their eponymous debut album, released just three months after that, climbed all the way to an astonishing No. 2 on the UK album charts, amidst controversies over lyrics that touched on homosexuality, pedophilia and murdered children. After a 1984 that was jam-packed with Peel Sessions and fantastic singles, culminating in the November release of the excellent &lt;i&gt;Hatful of Hollow&lt;/i&gt; comp, it should perhaps be of no surprise that their second proper album would reach No. 1 upon its release in February 1985.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Meat is Murder &lt;/i&gt;boasts a fuller, more polished production than its predecessor, which was criticized in some quarters for John Porter\'s murky, flat rendering, and from the thunderous beginning of "The Headmaster\'s Ritual" it\'s clear that this is an angrier, more indignant album than the first one, starting it off with an acidic condemnation of the rigid hierarchy and corporal punishment that informed life at the school that one Steven Morrissey had the misfortune of attending as a child. Even the delightfully bouncy rockabilly of "Rusholme Ruffians" is occupied with violent hooliganism on the last night of the fair, while also acknowledging that "my faith in love is still devout!" After all, on a night like this, "someone falls in love, and someone\'s beaten up". Morrissey gets political for the first time in "Nowhere Fast", wherein he states: "I\'d like to drop my trousers to the Queen/Every sensible child will know what this means/The poor and the needy are selfish and greedy/On her terms!" "Barbarism Begins at Home" expands on the themes of "Headmaster\'s Ritual" to thrilling effect, over seven minutes of tense disco/funk, with its incessant refrain of "a crack on the head is what you get!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scabrous streak culminates in the closing title track, whose stern anti-meat proselytizing may have been bold coming off of a chart-topping album in 1985, but which is also quite possibly The Smiths\' weakest song. Over a musically uncharacteristic, plodding dirge, and six minutes, Morrissey melodramatically condemns "the flesh you so fancifully fry", "the calf that you carve with a smile" and "the turkey you festively slice" as "MURDER!" It\'s admirable on some level that Morrissey sang about something which was (and still is) obviously very important to him, at a time when PETA was only five years old and just beginning to attract substantial attention, but the song confirms that the base-level "Finger-Pointin\' Song" was not The Smiths\' forte, easily the least inventive (both musically and lyrically speaking) and most tedious song the group recorded in its brief lifespan. It\'s a big part of the reason that &lt;i&gt;Meat is Murder&lt;/i&gt; as an album isn\'t the equal of &lt;i&gt;The Smiths&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Hatful of Hollow&lt;/i&gt; or the follow-up &lt;i&gt;The Queen is Dead,&lt;/i&gt; but there\'s no doubt that it\'s got plenty of worthy moments, including one of their very best ballads in "That Joke Isn\'t Funny Anymore", and the other highlights mentioned earlier.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2016/01/the-smiths-meat-is-murder-1985.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xLGir5eez58/Vo7xYjKetsI/AAAAAAAABOs/dFN_KejK4hE/s72-c/MeatMurder.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1979760618572443997</guid><pubdate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 09:40:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-21T01:40:25.047-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>David Bowie "The Man Who Sold the World" (1970)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-COEWQG_EAlc/VlAzdBUpg9I/AAAAAAAABOI/mwJGObykZKA/s1600/MI0003889912.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="316" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-COEWQG_EAlc/VlAzdBUpg9I/AAAAAAAABOI/mwJGObykZKA/s320/MI0003889912.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the span of about five years, a young, hungry Bowie shifted his musical focus from straight, R&amp;amp;B-derived rock &amp;amp; roll, to mod pop, to lite-entertainment music hall, to hippie folk-rock, and all he had to show for it by the time the sixties ended was essentially a novelty hit in the form of "Space Oddity", although that was certainly an uncommonly dark and existential song to be considered as such. It hinted at his immense potential as a singer/songwriter, but as critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray once said of his third album, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Sold the World &lt;/i&gt;is where the story &lt;i&gt;really &lt;/i&gt;starts. The cover art for the album\'s British release, which curiously came several months after its American debut, was a statement unto itself, depicting a very convincingly ladylike Bowie in a dress and sporting long, curly blonde locks. Accordingly, the album\'s sweeping, complex opener, "The Width of a Circle", harbors thinly veiled references to male homosexuality, which had essentially only been decriminalized in the UK a mere three years earlier. It was most certainly not a staggering, singular breakthrough as a song, as good as it is, but the more important thing is that it immediately announces that the former David Jones was definitely onto something, here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day, &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Sold the World&lt;/i&gt; is still nothing short of a glaring anomaly in Bowie\'s extensive discography, second only perhaps to his Anthony Newley-esque 1967 debut in how surprising it is to many who hear it after becoming accustomed to the stuff that made him a superstar in the 70\'s and 80\'s, which is saying something considering just how unexpected and challenging his work during that time could often be. The predominant sound here is a heavy rock stomp not far from that of Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, which is nonetheless offset by Bowie\'s nascent science-fiction themes and Nietzschean bent. For better or for worse (most likely the former, honestly), he would never return to these heavy metal waters, these waters which have him yowling songs like the Zeppelin-esque "She Shook Me Cold" and "Black Country Rock". As convincing as it all is, and respectably as he puts on the Robert Plant or Ozzy Osbourne hat here, one still can\'t help but get the feeling that there was only so far he could go with it, and better on both him and all of us that he saved that particular side of his musical character for this particular album only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The title track, which is the album\'s obvious showpiece, was probably the single best and most spellbinding song he\'d written (or at least recorded) yet, matched with an ominous performance that radiated dreamlike mystique and intrigue, and as startling as Nirvana\'s brooding, bone-chilling reading was at their performance for MTV\'s Unplugged series over two decades later, it\'s honestly something of a shame that many people only know the song by their cover version. It has to still be one of Bowie\'s finest moments as a singer, performer and songwriter. There\'s also the particularly underrated, haunted lullaby "After All", with Bowie barely rising above a whisper as he sketches out something that resembles a particularly sinister, half-recalled childhood nightmare, joined in the verses by a truly creepy chorus line of "Oh by jingo".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it\'s no surprise that &lt;i&gt;The Man Who Sold the World&lt;/i&gt; would not be Bowie\'s true breakthrough, creatively or commercially, but it remains an important and slightly cast-aside item in that long list of albums and side-projects he\'s been involved in since its release, and as mentioned before, it is &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; crucial turning point in his career, the album that started him on the road to the dizzying heights of Ziggy Stardust and beyond, and it\'s no accident that the ultimate success turned out to be just around the corner.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/david-bowie-man-who-sold-world-1970.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-COEWQG_EAlc/VlAzdBUpg9I/AAAAAAAABOI/mwJGObykZKA/s72-c/MI0003889912.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-201352093962707398</guid><pubdate>Fri, 13 Nov 2015 08:25:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-13T00:25:22.259-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Mott the Hoople "All the Young Dudes" (1972)/"Mott" (1973)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zX-78i6_27g/VkWMM03cQNI/AAAAAAAABM4/kDBbfJeqdjI/s1600/MI0001533774.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="285" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zX-78i6_27g/VkWMM03cQNI/AAAAAAAABM4/kDBbfJeqdjI/s320/MI0001533774.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In 1972, David Bowie was not only England\'s biggest new pop star, having revitalized his own once-lagging career with &lt;i&gt;The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars&lt;/i&gt;, but he also became a notoriously generous benefactor to the success of artists he admired. He lent a seemingly magical touch to Lou Reed with the unlikely breakthrough of &lt;i&gt;Transformer&lt;/i&gt;, Iggy and the Stooges\' epochal swan song &lt;i&gt;Raw Power&lt;/i&gt;, and a little-known, just-disbanded rock &amp;amp; roll outfit called Mott the Hoople. They returned to Great Britain from Sweden in the spring of \'72, having called it a day as a band after putting out several albums that endured a tepid commercial reception, when Bowie got in touch with them, wanting to produce an album for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He offered them his classic "Suffragette City" to record, which they turned down while asking for "Drive-In Saturday" instead, and they wound up recording a tune called "All the Young Dudes". Standing where it does today as a regular of classic rock radio, it can be hard for casual listeners to believe that this song, which Ian Hunter renders so convincingly like a heartfelt ode to young guys sticking together through adversity as they enter adulthood, is actually tied up with the apocalyptic themes of &lt;i&gt;Ziggy Stardust&lt;/i&gt;. "The news" that "the dudes" are carrying in that swelling, moving chorus is the same news that made the newscaster weep in an earlier Bowie song, in other words the news that the planet Earth only has five years left to live. You might remember it? Whether people understood that aspect of the song didn\'t matter; the song when released as a single shot to #3 on the UK Singles Chart, and even went to #40 in a glam-suspicious United States, and became a ready-made anthem for all those bedraggled kids who clung to the early-70\'s glitter &amp;amp; glam rock aesthetic as a way of life, and the Hoople were resurrected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the Bowie-produced album of the same name, the title track inevitably overshadows everything else on it, but it\'s the most consistent full-length that the group had yet put together, save maybe for the hotwired rock &amp;amp; roll of the immediately preceding &lt;i&gt;Brain Capers. &lt;/i&gt;Yes, the rather pedestrian run-through of The Velvet Underground\'s "Sweet Jane" is hardly the best or most striking cover version of one of Lou Reed\'s most widely beloved songs, let alone the most thrilling album opener they could\'ve had for their most successful LP to date. But there\'s also the swampy, cowbell-flecked "Sucker", with its quirky introductory line, "Hi there/Your friendly neighborhood sadist/Wanna take you for a ride", plus the Stonesy "Jerkin\' Crocus" and a fine early version of "Ready for Love", written and sung by guitarist Mick Ralphs before it became a bigger hit with his later group Bad Company. The sorrowful "Sea Diver" represents another fine example of Ian Hunter\'s much-remarked-on sentimental streak, and makes for a more fitting and effective album closer than "Sweet Jane" did as an album opener.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, &lt;i&gt;All the Young Dudes&lt;/i&gt; may not quite be the equal of Bowie\'s own &lt;i&gt;Ziggy Stardust&lt;/i&gt; album, or even Reed\'s &lt;i&gt;Transformer &lt;/i&gt;for that matter, but it\'s still one of the key works of that brief period where theatrical, gender-bending glam rock seized the English pop audience. That\'s only sartorially, though, and via the association with Bowie; Mott were easily the least arty, least avant-garde and least androgynous artists to benefit from Bowie\'s assistance at the time. In that respect, &lt;i&gt;All the Young Dudes&lt;/i&gt; is, musically speaking, best heard as simply one of the finest, most underrated, and most idiosyncratic hard rock records of its time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-50hixXhoUlU/VkWV7zy8WGI/AAAAAAAABNM/Ib9QWsCYpjw/s1600/MI0001675736.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="313" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-50hixXhoUlU/VkWV7zy8WGI/AAAAAAAABNM/Ib9QWsCYpjw/s320/MI0001675736.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;What do you do when you\'re in your early thirties and have finally connected with your last-ditch grab for rock stardom? Well, if you\'re like Ian Hunter, you apparently put together a follow-up album laden with withering sarcasm about the stress of fame and the road, including a devastating ballad written after the night that your band decided to call it quits before unexpectedly finding success. 1973\'s &lt;i&gt;Mott&lt;/i&gt; comes barreling in with the 50\'s throwback "All the Way from Memphis", which apparently makes reference to real-life incident when Mick Ralphs lost his guitar on tour, with a variable, infectious chorus that includes choice words like "as your name gets hot, your heart grows cold" and "you gotta stay young, man, you can never be old!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s the perfect lead-off track for an undoubtedly stronger album than its predecessor, even if it lacks something quite as moving and memorable as "All the Young Dudes". It\'s a looser, funnier, more ramshackle album, at least if you\'re talking about songs like "Memphis" or the soaring, jubilant "Honaloochie Boogie", or the zinger-hook chorus of "Drivin\' Sister" or the rumbling shuffle of "Whizz Kid". Elsewhere, you have the exceedingly odd, decidedly slight "Violence", which Hunter starts off by hollering "missing link/poolroom stink/I can\'t talk", mumbling the refrain of "violence, violence/it\'s the only thing that\'ll make you see sense" as a busy violin accentuates the melody. "I\'m a Cadillac", sung by the soon-to-depart Ralphs, is a respectable enough rocker, but then, much like how his "Ready for Love" morphed into the wandering "After Lights" on the previous album, it meanders off into a jazzy, murky instrumental ("El Camino Dolo Roso"), which is a bit of a drag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This means that like its predecessor, &lt;i&gt;Mott &lt;/i&gt;doesn\'t always live up to its tremendous promise, but it doesn\'t make it anything less than the group\'s finest, most solid album. Hunter expands upon the melancholy of "Sea Diver" with the grand, orchestral lament "Hymn for the Dudes", and then with the even more startling "Ballad of Mott the Hoople (March 26, 1972-Zurich)", the aforementioned song written after what the group thought would be its final gig, just months before hitting it big with Bowie\'s help. He admits that "rock &amp;amp; roll\'s a loser\'s game", but "it mesmerizes, I can\'t explain the reasons for the sights and for the sounds". If that isn\'t one of the most touching, heartfelt and brutally honest statements any songwriter has ever come up with to describe what dedicated rock &amp;amp; rollers will go through to live as musicians, I for one haven\'t heard much else quite like it. Hunter\'s heart-on-the-sleeve masterstroke comes in the form of the closing "I Wish I Was Your Mother", a sad yet sweet song about a man coming to a sobering realization that his relationship is doomed to failure, and that it\'s got a lot to do with his own faults, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Mott&lt;/i&gt; could stand up to some improvement and isn\'t as great an album as it could\'ve been, it\'s still a considerably overlooked gem, appropriate perhaps for the best work of a band which in itself is certainly one of the most widely overlooked and underappreciated in rock &amp;amp; roll history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/mott-hoople-all-young-dudes-1972mott.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zX-78i6_27g/VkWMM03cQNI/AAAAAAAABM4/kDBbfJeqdjI/s72-c/MI0001533774.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4561661779532289643</guid><pubdate>Thu, 12 Nov 2015 19:01:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-12T11:04:33.858-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Cheap Trick "Cheap Trick" (1977)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NMmHSXr2NJE/VkTXCyc7LkI/AAAAAAAABMk/alKAznNFtw8/s1600/MI0001714118.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="316" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NMmHSXr2NJE/VkTXCyc7LkI/AAAAAAAABMk/alKAznNFtw8/s320/MI0001714118.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From the time they formed and started relentlessly woodshedding their material in Illinois bars, Cheap Trick was exactly what American hard rock needed at a time (mid-late 70\'s, to be exact) when it was getting ever blander and more predictable. With their mix of roaring guitars and swelling melodies, they certainly weren\'t punk rock as it has come to be defined in the decades since it first emerged, at roughly the same time as these boys from Rockford, but it\'s no surprise that many observers lumped Cheap Trick in with the punk/new wave uprising upon the release of their eponymous, initially low-selling 1977 debut album. It\'s packed with tighter, better songs than, say, &lt;i&gt;Frampton Comes Alive! &lt;/i&gt;or the latest Foghat album, and is coursing with the kind of giddy excitement that a lot of the more commercially successful FM-dwelling rock acts had seemingly forgotten how to generate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produced by Jack Douglas, who was then known primarily for his work with Aerosmith, the Tricksters\' first album often rocks harder and feels more aggressive than the gleaming power-pop sound that they would soon become successful with. It\'s not just Douglas\' production, which simply hits harder than the slicker, more melodic sound Tom Werman would give them on their next two albums, the disappointingly emasculated &lt;i&gt;In Color&lt;/i&gt; and the spectacular &lt;i&gt;Heaven Tonight&lt;/i&gt;. The subject matter of the songs is often considerably darker than the later hits, including a song dedicated to mass-murderer Richard Speck ("The Ballad of TV Violence"), another one alluding to pedophilia ("Daddy Should Have Stayed in High School"), and the album\'s only single at the time of its release, the surging "Oh Candy", which is about the suicide of a photographer friend of the band\'s. With the exception of "Candy", these songs are sung with considerable sarcasm and black humor, while not exactly turning them into mere gallows humor either. They had picked up a sense of oddball, deviant humor from cult pop heroes like The Move, and would continue to extrapolate on this most valuable attribute even in bigger, more well-known hits like "Surrender", what with its lyrics making reference to venereal disease, junkie Vietnam vets and parents smoking their kids\' pot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes without saying that the band itself, as well as singer Robin Zander, had gigged so much, from their bar band days through tours with acts like Rush, Kiss and Santana, that the performances on their first album were almost guaranteed to be top-notch, and indeed they are. Rick Nielsen, who\'s also the primary writer and composer of all the group\'s original songs here, was already a fantastic guitarist, versatile and capable of both ripping it up and spinning out sophisticated melodies. Goofball drummer Bun E. Carlos and bassist Tom Peterson hold down a formidable rhythm section, from the Gary Glitter stomp of the opening "ELO Kiddies" and the punky, amphetamine charge of "He\'s a Whore" to the subdued, hypnotic pulse underneath the dreamy, druggy "Mandocello". They would only continue to improve over the next two or three years, but there\'s no doubt that Cheap Trick were strong enough just two years into their existence to cut a fully-formed, near-perfect album as the very first one to hit the racks, if not quite yet the upper echelons of the singles or album charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the band wasn\'t a real part of the true-blue punk revolution, they did end up being an equally influential force of their own, an influence which revealed itself over a considerably lengthy period of time. Most of the fashion-victim hair metal bands which took over rock radio in the mid-late 80\'s owed a huge debt to Cheap Trick, but so did most of the alternative rockers which took their place in the early-mid 90\'s, which is the kind of duality that makes for a truly exceptional and influential band, whose best music has stood the test of time astonishingly well compared to many (if not most) other hard-rock bands that were successful in the late 70\'s.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/cheap-trick-cheap-trick-1977.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NMmHSXr2NJE/VkTXCyc7LkI/AAAAAAAABMk/alKAznNFtw8/s72-c/MI0001714118.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4226320197169798448</guid><pubdate>Wed, 11 Nov 2015 05:15:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-10T21:15:09.612-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>T.

Rex to superstardom in the UK, not to mention a lone US Top Ten hit with "Bang a Gong", so it\'s only fitting that their breakthrough album\'s successor boasts a more polished production and just &lt;i&gt;feels &lt;/i&gt;like the sound of a guy who\'s on top of the world and reveling in every moment of it. It starts right off with one of two selections on &lt;i&gt;The Slider&lt;/i&gt; that shot to #1 on the UK Singles Chart, the irrepressibly cheerful "Metal Guru", which is surely one of the best openers for any rock album of the early 70\'s. The other top-selling single, "Telegram Sam", is even better, a gleefully hedonistic ode to Bolan\'s dope suppliers and various other hangers-on, not to mention Bob Dylan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As on &lt;i&gt;Electric Warrior&lt;/i&gt;, he still gives over a considerable amount of space to melancholy acoustic songs, and once again he sounds just as poignant in these songs as he does confident in the rockers. In "Spaceball Ricochet", he admits "With my Les Paul/I know I\'m small/But I enjoy living anyway", a surprisingly vulnerable sentiment from a guy who was the leader of a band which took England by storm like almost no other since The Beatles (whose Ringo Starr he was now close friends with, and who took the photos that appear on &lt;i&gt;The Slider&lt;/i&gt;\'s LP jacket to boot). Bolan and the band then surge full-bore into the uncommonly heavy, Zeppelin-esque "Buick MacKane" immediately thereafter, which is certainly a neat flip of the switch to pull off with such ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Slider&lt;/i&gt; treads upon the same basic territory as its predecessor, only it has even more exceptional album cuts and an even stronger smattering of smash-hit singles. In other words, it may not have any basic sonic elements that were missing from &lt;i&gt;Electric Warrior&lt;/i&gt;, but it does everything that album did louder, more joyously and ultimately even better than before. Just as The Beatles, eight years earlier, had hit the peak of their early years with &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day\'s Night&lt;/i&gt;, which radiates profusely and forevermore on wax with the initial glow and giddy thrill of Beatlemania, &lt;i&gt;The Slider&lt;/i&gt; captures the glorious, woefully short-lived height of&amp;nbsp; "T. Rextasy", and you can still hear that excitement in nearly each and every song. T. Rex would never be better than they were here.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/t-rex-slider-1972.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-apf1I4seZH8/VkLJYzSKW_I/AAAAAAAABMQ/00-Tr1Sof28/s72-c/MI0003035834.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-590624038413376932</guid><pubdate>Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:02:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-10T12:31:12.867-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>T.

It\'s just as well that it would be the album that made both him and T. Rex as a band into a sensation, because with &lt;i&gt;Electric Warrior &lt;/i&gt;the group arrived at a tremendously influential, distinctive sound that took Great Britain by storm. The album\'s down-and-dirty, hard-rockin\' sound had been glimpsed before, but it wasn\'t until songs like "Mambo Sun", "Jeepster" and of course "Bang a Gong (Get It On)" that it reached perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And "T. Rexstasy" couldn\'t have come at a better time. Just when the serious-minded, denim-and-bearded aesthetic of prog-rock had become the dominant force on British charts and in music weeklies, Bolan came along with a truly outrageous fashion sense and a bevy of infectiously catchy, sexually-charged rock &amp;amp; roll singles, loaded with warm, crunchy guitars, massive hooks and seemingly nonsensical lyrics. It was surely a far cry from the group\'s earlier incarnation as cult heroes Tyrannosaurus Rex, which consisted only of Bolan and percussionist Mickey Finn, and once put out an album entitled &lt;i&gt;My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair...But Now They\'re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows&lt;/i&gt;. But even on &lt;i&gt;Electric Warrior&lt;/i&gt;, Marc hasn\'t completely abandoned all traces of his hippie, freak-folk past; not with words like "O God/High in your fields above Earth" or "the throne of time is a kingly thing". With all the ease he gets acquainted with the lean, mean rock of the hit singles, "Lean Woman Blues", "The Motivator" and "Rip-Off", he shines just as brightly in melancholy acoustic ballads like "Cosmic Dancer" and "Life\'s a Gas", both of which sound a lot sadder now, especially when a man that had just six more years left to live is singing "Life\'s a gas/I hope it\'s gonna last". In "Dancer", he seemingly writes his own epitaph when he says "I danced myself right out the womb", and then later on "I\'ll dance myself into the tomb", and I\'ll be damned if that\'s not just exactly what he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the sunshine-pop optimism and idealism of the 60\'s faded further into the setting sun of rock &amp;amp; roll at the beginning of the 70\'s, Marc revamped Rex at precisely the right time, penning terrifically sexy pop songs that dripped with the sleaze and hedonism that were now front and center of the new rock culture. It gave inspiration for David Bowie to craft his flamboyant Ziggy Stardust persona, bringing him even greater success than Bolan, and "glam rock" was born, bringing that intoxicating sense of the outrageous that rock &amp;amp; roll had started off with back where it belonged. &lt;i&gt;Electric Warrior &lt;/i&gt;is without a doubt one of the very best, most influential and most emblematic albums of its time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/t-rex-electric-warrior-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-W0rz5qumLks/VkERBH8xR-I/AAAAAAAABL4/Q7bQKDvrZKA/s72-c/MI0003282349.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8623320466430568130</guid><pubdate>Thu, 05 Nov 2015 20:44:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-11-05T12:48:09.832-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bad Brains "Rock for Light" (1983)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dmQCKdqOUIE/VjvAfwlNQYI/AAAAAAAABLU/54FsztJSN58/s1600/MI0000679271.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dmQCKdqOUIE/VjvAfwlNQYI/AAAAAAAABLU/54FsztJSN58/s320/MI0000679271.jpg" width="319" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Bad Brains\' classic eponymous 1982 debut cemented the fabled D.C. band\'s reputation as one of the very best bands to see live in the American punk underground. It also unexpectedly captured the attention of none other than Cars mastermind Ric Ocasek, who soon approached the band about producing for them. The result of their collaboration, 1983\'s &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light&lt;/i&gt;, would be their first full-length vinyl release at the time, being as the first album was originally released only on cassette tape for ROIR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Owing both to Ocasek\'s involvement and a lack of the limitations imposed by the previous album\'s recording circumstances, &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light&lt;/i&gt; boasts a much fuller, more ferocious sound than its tinny predecessor. In light of this, it\'s not surprising that the Brains would want to take another shot at a few songs they\'d already done for the first album, so there\'s six songs here ("Attitude", "F.V.K.", "Banned in D.C.", "Sailin\' On", "Right Brigade" and "Big Takeover") that already appeared on the ROIR cassette. To be honest, their presence slightly hampers &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light &lt;/i&gt;as a whole, an obvious side effect of recycling old material, but you\'d have to be the most vehement adherent of lo-fi recording to think that the improved sound does anything but good to them. It\'s also a plus that all six of them are from the fast &amp;amp; furious side of their musical character, because the louder, fuller sound makes them sound even more vicious than before, taken along with how H.R. is even more unhinged as a vocalist and the band is playing even faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same goes for the other hard &amp;amp; fast numbers, like "Coptic Times", "How Low Can a Punk Get?", the title track and "At the Movies", but that\'s not the only facet of the Brains\' immense talents that is nourished here; "Rally Around Jah Throne", "The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth" and especially "I and I Survive" are even better as reggae selections than the ones that appeared on the previous album. Ocasek makes them all sound sweeter, and H.R.\'s voice more soulful than the earlier recordings. &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light&lt;/i&gt; would be the Bad Brains\' last recording for several years, as they broke up for the first of several times to follow shortly after its release and would remain inactive until they re-emerged with the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;I Against I &lt;/i&gt;in 1986. By that time, the early-80\'s American hardcore scene that they\'d helped foster was essentially a thing of the past. Because of this, even though &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light &lt;/i&gt;isn\'t quite the equal of the ROIR cassette, it\'s still a valuable piece of their work, the last gasp of the Brains as they were in their early years, the band that would go from the most furious hardcore punk to the smoothest reggae on the drop of a dime.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/11/bad-brains-rock-for-light-1983.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dmQCKdqOUIE/VjvAfwlNQYI/AAAAAAAABLU/54FsztJSN58/s72-c/MI0000679271.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5318231782337119384</guid><pubdate>Sat, 31 Oct 2015 01:23:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-10-30T18:23:34.683-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Syd Barrett "The Madcap Laughs" (1970)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYMvXx40w_4/VjQJDAm4FCI/AAAAAAAABKY/2VNgVbN7S4A/s1600/MI0001389173.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="311" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYMvXx40w_4/VjQJDAm4FCI/AAAAAAAABKY/2VNgVbN7S4A/s320/MI0001389173.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It must\'ve been quite a bizarre thing for early fans of the burgeoning Pink Floyd to see the group\'s leader, Syd Barrett, leave the fold just months after the release of their 1967 debut album, &lt;i&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/i&gt;. Like the later disintegration of American psychedelic contemporaries Skip Spence and Roky Erickson, Barrett\'s mental state seemed to deteriorate at an extraordinary rate; by all accounts, by the time the Floyd began recording &lt;i&gt;Piper&lt;/i&gt;, Syd already seemed totally disconnected from what was going on around him, having become a regular user of LSD at the beginning of that year. In their regular live performances at the UFO Club, he\'d gotten into the habit of standing onstage, motionless with his Telecaster hanging round his neck, and when they went to America for their first appearances both onstage and on television there, he flummoxed in equal measure audiences at venues like the Fillmore in San Francisco, and TV hosts Dick Clark and Pat Boone, to whom he was totally unresponsive when it came to the standard pop-show questionnaire. The jaunt went so poorly that management aborted the tour, and had them flown back to England within a month. Another aborted tour of the UK with Jimi Hendrix followed at the end of the year, at which point the far more stable David Gilmour joined the group, and by January 1968, the near-impossible-to-work-with Barrett was officially gone from the Floyd as a recording and performing unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was far from finished as a singer/songwriter in his own right, however, as evidenced by the other four members\' initial resolve to keep him in the band as a songwriter and creative force, as opposed to a performer, as The Beach Boys had done when Brian Wilson could no longer handle their touring schedule. Although this quickly proved not to be a viable option, Gilmour and Floyd co-founder Roger Waters did serve as the producers for some of the sessions for what turned out to be &lt;i&gt;The Madcap Laughs&lt;/i&gt;, released at the beginning of 1970 as the first of only two proper solo albums Barrett would ever record. The album\'s genesis was remarkably convoluted, with a wildly erratic series of sessions that spanned a fifteen-month period from May 1968 to August of \'69, featuring production-wise input from Floyd manager Peter Jenner and Malcolm Jones prior to Waters and Gilmour coming in towards the end of this period of time. The final product is, appropriately, a wildly erratic collection of songs which range from Barrett alone with his guitar, howling the desolate "Dark Globe" with harrowing desperation, to him and a passel of overdubbed accompanists (including the whole of the Soft Machine\'s then-current lineup, on two tracks) skipping through whimsical pop songs like "Love You" and "Here I Go". It goes without saying that &lt;i&gt;Madcap &lt;/i&gt;is all over the map, which is certainly a fitting reflection of Barrett\'s completely disheveled state, but does not result in a completely consistent album. Despite the presence of positively bewitching songs like "Octopus", "Golden Hair", "Dark Globe" and "Terrapin", it gets rather tediously incoherent towards the end with the loosely grouped "suite" of "She Took a Long Cold Look", "Feel" and "If It\'s In You", united only by the false starts and studio banter going on between them, and for these three songs being without a doubt the most unfocused, and unfinished, takes that made it to the final LP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake that &lt;i&gt;The Madcap Laughs&lt;/i&gt; is certainly not as strong as &lt;i&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/i&gt;, but as one of only two proper albums Barrett would put out after his woefully brief tenure with the Pink Floyd came to a fractious end, it\'s a valuable document of the man who has been called the greatest cult figure in rock history, without many arguments to the contrary. Syd was an undeniably talented and unique artist whose career was thoroughly derailed just when it was starting to flourish, and then the man just gave it all up and retired to a completely anonymous life until he died at 60, and consequently there\'s not much of his work that ultimately made it to tape. With that in mind, anything you can hear from his small body of work is worth listening to, and &lt;i&gt;Madcap&lt;/i&gt; remains a thoroughly compelling, fascinating product of a mind that went through a kind of tumult that most of us will never really be able to understand.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/10/syd-barrett-madcap-laughs-1970.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-MYMvXx40w_4/VjQJDAm4FCI/AAAAAAAABKY/2VNgVbN7S4A/s72-c/MI0001389173.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2288160706829371703</guid><pubdate>Sat, 24 Oct 2015 02:41:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-10-23T21:16:21.837-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Silver Apples "Silver Apples" (1968)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sTVAwHH_cY0/VirwYCeit5I/AAAAAAAABJY/HLnW83q5WcA/s1600/MI0002785351.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="310" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sTVAwHH_cY0/VirwYCeit5I/AAAAAAAABJY/HLnW83q5WcA/s320/MI0002785351.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Like contemporary releases by The Velvet Underground, The Stooges and Captain Beefheart, the Silver Apples\' eponymous first album was one of those late-60\'s oddities which went largely ignored in its day, but later found recognition as a touchstone for much of what was to come, in terms of cutting edge pop and rock music, after the fire of The Beatles and the acid generation went out. In an age where the vast majority of mainstream pop is almost entirely electronic, and record-making is almost exclusively done with digital equipment, &lt;i&gt;Silver Apples&lt;/i&gt; feels especially prescient, not really presaging the future of rock as The Velvets and Stooges did, but pointing the way to a future where the electric guitar would no longer be the predominant instrument in pop music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s funny, then, that the Apples had their genesis in a forgotten New York rock &amp;amp; roll band, the Overland Stage Electric Band. Their lead vocalist, Simeon Coxe, started fiddling around with a few oscillators during breaks between songs in the group\'s live performances, and soon became deeply fascinated with the sounds they would make. Drummer Danny Taylor started digging what Simeon was getting up to, and before long the other three members of the group dropped out of the picture, leaving the twosome that introduced, among their other innovations, the duo format that would come to permeate synthpop and much electronic-based music in general, from their fellow New Yorkers Suicide to any number of British acts that came to commercial prominence in the early 80\'s (Soft Cell, Yaz, Bronski Beat, etc.) Simeon, an enigmatic figure that normally went under just his first name, assembled a formidable noise-making machine of nine oscillators with eighty-six manual controls, dubbing it The Simeon, while Taylor\'s tribal percussion drove their songs as much as The Simeon\'s blips and burbles. Simeon\'s own singing voice, sometimes in harmony with Taylor, was emblematic of 60\'s folk rock, much like their quintessentially Age of Aquarius lyrics, many of which on their first album were actually composed by a poet friend of theirs named Stanley Warren, but the music behind those words and that voice was anything but. Electronic instruments had already been worming their way into pop music for some time, like the theremin heard in The Beach Boys\' "Good Vibrations" or the Moog synth in Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel\'s "Save the Life of My Child", but the Silver Apples were among the very first artists for which electronic sounds were the basis of their material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the songs here are terrific, memorable ones, too; the opening "Oscillations", which was apparently (and fittingly) the first song that Simeon ever wrote, immediately settles into the hypnotic pulse that runs through all of the remaining eight songs, in which Simeon intones in his fragile wisp of a voice that "my only world is sound". As cosmically blissed-out as the lyrics come across, for better or worse, it\'s a spooky, haunting sound going on behind them, especially in the downright ominous "Lovefingers", "Velvet Cave" and "Dancing Gods", which directly predict the otherworldly drone of Krautrockers like Can, Neu! and Faust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took many years for a large enough amount of people to understand how groundbreaking &lt;i&gt;Silver Apples &lt;/i&gt;really was, about 25 years after the duo released their second album (1969\'s &lt;i&gt;Contact&lt;/i&gt;) and then promptly disappeared, at which point in the mid-90\'s Simeon decided to revive the name with a new partner to begin performing again. Now, with close to fifty years\' hindsight, the Silver Apples\' first album looks like one of the most audacious and hugely influential albums of the decade, a record which still sounds fresh and mysterious all these years later.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/10/silver-apples.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sTVAwHH_cY0/VirwYCeit5I/AAAAAAAABJY/HLnW83q5WcA/s72-c/MI0002785351.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4544037516614793446</guid><pubdate>Tue, 06 Oct 2015 02:46:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-10-05T19:46:10.850-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "Bringing It All Back Home" (1965)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LBhAtln3eNs/VhMrszXMdUI/AAAAAAAABIY/KEBRxndepQ8/s1600/MI0002424512.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="284" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LBhAtln3eNs/VhMrszXMdUI/AAAAAAAABIY/KEBRxndepQ8/s320/MI0002424512.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Dylan began 1964 as America\'s most notorious folk troubadour and protest singer, as represented by &lt;i&gt;The Times They Are A-Changin\'&lt;/i&gt;, and ended the year with a considerable backlash against him slowly brewing in the folk music community that had nurtured him and brought him the recognition that he had at that point. &lt;i&gt;Another Side of Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt; was just about totally devoid of the sort of solemn moral messages that most people seemed to associate with his name, prompting Sing Out! magazine editor Irwin Sibler to chastise Dylan for getting caught up in "the paraphernalia of fame" and "losing touch with the people". Nobody who was disappointed with his change of lyrical direction could\'ve predicted the outrage they would then feel when &lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home&lt;/i&gt;, released in January 1965, led off with seven songs recorded with a full, electric band behind him, the first of them being the sarcasm and absurdity-laced, rough &amp;amp; ready blues-rock of "Subterranean Homesick Blues". It sounded like no other folk, blues or rock &amp;amp; roll song that had come before it, and was the perfect opening song for the album on which Dylan completely turned his back on the trappings of folk music\'s traditions and timeworn subject matter. And though it was the best album he\'d made up to that point, quite a few people were positively pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s quite amusing to look back fifty years later on the sincere moral outrage that so many of Dylan\'s fans and peers expressed at the time about his decision to boldly incorporate elements of hard-driving rock &amp;amp; roll and electric blues into his songs, but the fact of the matter is that a lot of those people thought he\'d simply sold out to the commercial interests of the time. Before Dylan did what he did then, folk music (along with jazz, classical and the blues) was viewed as "serious music" in the eyes of \'sophisticated\' music aficionados, and rock &amp;amp; roll was viewed as mindless, disposable teenage noise. Folk in particular was associated with a kind of left-liberal moral purity, and socially conscious idealism, which made it something of a sacred cow in the eyes of many of its contemporary followers and performers. The fact that pop and rock &amp;amp; roll music had suddenly received a huge shot in the arm mattered little; to them, the British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles and The Stones was just a newer manifestation of an inherently juvenile, passing trend, what with all those woefully delusional teen girls who screamed their heads off at their concerts. With the entirely electric first half of &lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home&lt;/i&gt; as the starting point, Bob Dylan in 1965 did more than any other performer or songwriter to completely, and irreversibly, alter this perception. It\'s not only the watershed and the turning point of Dylan\'s career, but also one of a handful of truly epochal, game-changing albums in the history of popular music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the electric half inevitably received more attention at the time, the second, entirely acoustic one is just as important; "Mr. Tambourine Man" followed the lead of some of the more mystical songs on &lt;i&gt;Another Side&lt;/i&gt;, a gorgeously moving number that feels personal and introspective in a lot of places, like a reflection on the demands of being a popular performer, but also on the other hand like a surreal daydream, brimming with abstract imagery. It would also lead to the advent of "folk-rock" as the biggest new trend in pop music, when a new band from L.A. called The Byrds got ahold of an early acetate of the song and transformed it into a Beatlesque pop hit, aided by a chiming 12-string guitar and the group\'s marvelous harmony singing. "Gates of Eden" and "It\'s Alright, Ma (I\'m Only Bleeding)" are even more cryptic, loaded with striking turns of phrase like "the relationships of ownership", "money doesn\'t talk, it swears", "sometimes even the president of the United States has to stand naked". The album comes to a close with the failed romance of "It\'s All Over Now, Baby Blue", but it\'s the elliptical, seemingly indecipherable imagery of the earlier three songs which Dylan would only continue to pursue on his following two albums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home&lt;/i&gt; is a startling piece of work, the bold, brash introduction of a very new kind of artist in the pop music arena, but in hindsight many view it as just the prelude to the even better &lt;i&gt;Highway 61 Revisited&lt;/i&gt;, released later in \'65. It\'s a testament to just how on top of his game Dylan was in the mid-60\'s to think that an album as masterful as &lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home&lt;/i&gt; was just a warm-up exercise.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/10/bob-dylan-bringing-it-all-back-home-1965.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LBhAtln3eNs/VhMrszXMdUI/AAAAAAAABIY/KEBRxndepQ8/s72-c/MI0002424512.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-549221413677590720</guid><pubdate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 01:30:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-10-03T20:53:26.313-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "The Times They Are A-Changin\'" (1964)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lLkngY5MfMk/Vg3SHk2B-EI/AAAAAAAABIA/LZ2p68DSc-g/s1600/MI0002208215.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="317" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lLkngY5MfMk/Vg3SHk2B-EI/AAAAAAAABIA/LZ2p68DSc-g/s320/MI0002208215.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt; introduced the former Bobby Zimmerman to the world as not only the biggest new star of the American folk revival of the early 60\'s, but also as one of the leading figures of the burgeoning left-wing political activism that swept college campuses of the time and would continue to flower as the decade progressed. &lt;i&gt;Freewheelin\'&lt;/i&gt; was a richly diverse effort that ranged from the socially conscious leanings of "Blowin\' in the Wind", "Masters of War" and "A Hard Rain\'s a-Gonna Fall" to the tender love songs like "Girl from the North Country" and "Corinna, Corinna", with plenty of absurdist humor sprinkled along the way. Nonetheless, it was the socially conscious, leftist side that the public at large seemed to fixate on at the time; in the minds of many, Dylan was definitively a "protest" folk singer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps with this in mind, perhaps even in an uncharacteristic attempt to "give the people what they wanted", 1964\'s &lt;i&gt;Times They Are A-Changin\'&lt;/i&gt; was almost entirely dominated by political material, right from the opening title track, which is every bit the standard that "Blowin\' in the Wind" is today, and just as good a song. If there were ever just one near-supernaturally prescient song in popular music history, here it is; Dylan himself stopped performing it for a number of years after he made his move to electric rock accompaniment, just a year after its release as the leadoff track on the album, but it truly took on a life of its own, and would be recorded by a veritable laundry list of diverse artists in the mid-to-late 60\'s, an early signpost for a tremendously turbulent era. The times really &lt;i&gt;were&lt;/i&gt; a-changin\', and more than they had in America for a very long time, and five decades later America is still grappling with the ramifications of those changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\'s also the fantastically pointed "Only a Pawn in Their Game", which was perhaps the most thematically advanced political song he\'d yet come up with, describing how poor and/or uneducated white people (like the white man who\'d just recently assassinated civil rights leader Medgar Evers) are, in their own way, victimized by America\'s racially prejudiced socioeconomic system and its crooked racist politicians just as much as "negro" Americans are. "With God on Our Side" is especially potent, a lengthy examination of American history and its wars, from when white Europeans killed and displaced Native Americans once upon a time, all the way up to the then-current Cold War, questioning all of the commonly-held preconceptions of all these things. "The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll" isn\'t as bluntly condemnatory as the similarly-themed, then-unreleased "Death of Emmett Till", but it\'s a brutally incisive account of how in 1963 a wealthy, well-connected heir of a tobacco farming family (Billy Zantzinger) murdered an African-American barmaid (Hattie Carroll) and got off with no more than six months in the lockup. In a year in which debates about sentencing disparities, police brutality, and racism in general in America have become more heated than they have been in a long time, it remains quite bitterly relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As strong as this material is, the album as a whole falls short of the standard set by its stunning predecessor, much of which is owed to how much less diverse it is both thematically and musically; it features a lot of the same ancient folk melodies and song structures being repeated more than once, and of course for many the dour, moralizing tone of much of Dylan\'s material this time around can be a bit tedious. Two songs, however, stand apart from the predominant theme, those two being the absolutely gorgeous, heartbroken "Boots of Spanish Leather" and the equally delicate "One Too Many Mornings". As it would turn out later, he essentially crafted this particular record on purpose as a protest-focused album, leaving several worthy, not-so-political songs that were cut during the sessions off of the final set. Maybe he needed to get all of his social-justice warrior (to use a most likely soon-to-be-dated, rather dumbass term) ambitions out of his system with a single LP, an idea bolstered by the fact that it\'s well-established that he was already growing tired of so-called "finger-pointin\' songs" by the time the album was released in January of 1964. The following &lt;i&gt;Another Side of Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt;, with lyrics inspired by French symbolism and Beat poetry and with his sense of humor fully restored, would be recorded just five months after that, setting the stage for his rediscovery of the kind of white-hot rock &amp;amp; roll he had loved as a teenager with 1965\'s &lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Highway 61 Revisited&lt;/i&gt;. None of this, however, should be taken to mean that &lt;i&gt;The Times They Are A-Changin\'&lt;/i&gt; is not a worthy or important item in his discography; in fact, it should be looked towards as a pioneering, early example of a concept album, being as Dylan quite clearly engineered it to have the recurring political themes that it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have any appreciation for Dylan\'s not-unimportant role as, for a time, a well-known white ally of the Civil Rights movement of the 60\'s, and by extension as an unwittingly galvanizing figure of the other social &amp;amp; political upheavals that would occur over the rest of the decade, his third album captures this side of him better than anything else he would ever record again.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/10/bob-dylan-times-they-are-changin-1964.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lLkngY5MfMk/Vg3SHk2B-EI/AAAAAAAABIA/LZ2p68DSc-g/s72-c/MI0002208215.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2931599933361642840</guid><pubdate>Thu, 24 Sep 2015 19:54:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-24T12:54:18.517-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Curtis Mayfield "Super Fly" (1972)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_89WHA7_y_Y/VgRKh00prBI/AAAAAAAABHE/099AC2VSbiw/s1600/MI0002323191.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="311" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_89WHA7_y_Y/VgRKh00prBI/AAAAAAAABHE/099AC2VSbiw/s320/MI0002323191.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Curtis Mayfield\'s soundtrack for the 1972 blaxploitation flick "Super Fly" is one of those soundtracks that stands apart from the film itself as a superb work of art on its own. The Beatles\' nominal soundtracks for &lt;i&gt;Help! &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;A Hard Day\'s Night&lt;/i&gt; are two well-known examples, of course, not to forget the one for &lt;i&gt;Saturday Night Fever. Super Fly &lt;/i&gt;is particularly extraordinary for how it completely transcends the film it was meant to accompany; commercially, the LP and its two singles ("Freddie\'s Dead" and the title track) outgrossed the film itself, but more importantly, Mayfield was at the peak of his powers as a keenly socially-conscious songwriter, taking the film\'s subject matter and spinning it into a tour de force, a song cycle about the players, pimps and dealers portrayed in the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His songs decry the problems befalling black America in the early 70\'s, but are rich with pity for pushers like the one in "Pusherman" ("a victim of ghetto romance", who\'s "been told I can\'t be nothin\' else/Just a hustler in spite of myself") or "Eddie You Should Have Known Better", and convey his righteous anger towards the apathy that surrounds the fall of the hopeless junkie in "Freddie\'s Dead". He\'s joyously happy that life is his natural high, and that the man can\'t put "No Thing On Me", but he doesn\'t sound arrogant. The title track encapsulates all the glamour surrounding the lead character Youngblood Priest\'s life of crime, but also his desire to get out from the drama and the danger that come with it, and because of that, to this day "Super Fly" is still one of the greatest songs anybody\'s ever written about ghetto crime or gangsters, even after a quarter century of gangsta rappers recycling some of the same themes. From beginning to end, Curtis has his eye dead-locked onto the mean streets of the ghetto, and he simply tells it like it really is, without sensationalism or excessive moralizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, he would have gotten nowhere with his magnificent words if he didn\'t have equally spectacular musical backing, and with its horns, wah-wah-drenched guitar, bongos and percolating bass lines, &lt;i&gt;Super Fly&lt;/i&gt; is not only one of the greatest touchstones of the sound of early 70\'s funk and R&amp;amp;B, but also a seminal influence on future TV and movie soundtrack producers. It established a subgenre unto itself for blaxploitation soundtracks, and would ultimately stand as the apotheosis of this loose category. As a matter of fact, it would represent the highest peak of Curtis Mayfield\'s extraordinary talents, the culmination of over a decade spent as one of the relatively few 60\'s soul singers to write most of his own material, progressing over the back half of that decade from the moving civil rights anthem "People Get Ready" to the more open-ended questions of "Choice of Colors", then hitting a stride when he split from The Impressions with the apocalyptic, chaotic funk of "(Don\'t Worry) If There\'s a Hell Below, We\'re All Gonna Go" and 1970\'s &lt;i&gt;Curtis&lt;/i&gt; album. &lt;i&gt;Super Fly&lt;/i&gt; is nothing short of his masterpiece, a summation of the immense musicality and excellent songwriting that would never again be quite as wonderfully on display as it was here.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/curtis-mayfield-super-fly-1972.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_89WHA7_y_Y/VgRKh00prBI/AAAAAAAABHE/099AC2VSbiw/s72-c/MI0002323191.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-932860949429490845</guid><pubdate>Wed, 23 Sep 2015 15:59:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-23T08:59:13.897-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bruce Springsteen "Nebraska" (1982)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ek-xhm2tRiM/VgKtqaYfQ7I/AAAAAAAABGw/MBHTahyvbz8/s1600/Bruce_Springsteen_-_Nebraska.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ek-xhm2tRiM/VgKtqaYfQ7I/AAAAAAAABGw/MBHTahyvbz8/s1600/Bruce_Springsteen_-_Nebraska.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With a few decades\' hindsight, when you think about it, Bruce Springsteen putting out something as virtually unadorned and resolutely grim as 1982\'s &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt; on Columbia Records was one of the most audacious, almost shocking moves ever made by an artist of his commercial stature. \'The Boss\' was coming off of the huge success of his 1980 double-album &lt;i&gt;The River&lt;/i&gt;, which would go on to be his third-best selling album and was supported by one of his most rapturously received concert tours. In the first days of 1982, he recorded what were intended to be demos for his next album at his home, on a Teac four-track machine, and eventually entered the studio with The E Street Band to make a \'proper\' album. But Springsteen and the engineers seemed to unanimously agree that his demo recordings actually sounded better for this particular set of songs than the full-band takes. Listening to the ten songs that make up &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt;, it really comes as no surprise that the E Street band version wouldn\'t have  worked quite so well for many of these songs, being as most of them, in  terms of their melodies and their structures, are rooted in traditional  country and American folk music, and therefore sound as though they were  meant to be performed alone anyway. There does exist an as-yet unreleased, complete alternate version of the album, recorded in the studio with the band, but it\'s Springsteen\'s home demos which became the final, released version of the album, and of course it sounds nothing like anything he had done before, or for that matter like anything any of his closest commercial contemporaries released in 1982.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raw, lo-fi audio quality of the album was startling enough, but the real key to &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt; is just how grim it really is in terms of Springsteen\'s songs, which had been getting progressively more pessimistic on &lt;i&gt;Darkness on the Edge of Town &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The River&lt;/i&gt;, and now he opened his latest album with a song about cold-blooded murder. The title track fades in with a desolate, wailing harmonica, leading into a pretty-sounding, well-worn traditional folk melody; it recounts the real-life tale of Charles Starkweather, who embarked on a brief murder spree stretching from Lincoln, Nebraska through Wyoming in 1958 with his fourteen-year-old girlfriend in tow, and whose story had already popped up in "Badlands" off of &lt;i&gt;Darkness&lt;/i&gt;. It\'s the song where that pessimism that had begun to surface more and more in Springsteen\'s writing turns to outright hopelessness, as he sings without emotion, in the voice of Starkweather, that "through the badlands of Wyoming, I killed everything in my path", and that "I can\'t say that I\'m sorry for the things we done/at least for a little while, sir, me and her we had some fun". Springsteen had just begun to focus more on the lives of those who had bleak, far-from-prosperous futures ahead of them, and here was a narrative about someone who had no future at all, about to be executed for committing ten brutal murders. Needless to say, it is absolutely bone-chilling, and it sets the tone for one of the most harrowing albums ever to reach the Top Five on the Billboard 200.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Atlantic City", the one moderate hit single to be pulled from &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt;, is only marginally more hopeful, with that so typically Springsteen-esque chorus line of "Everything dies, baby, that\'s a fact/But maybe everything that dies someday comes back", but only after it starts right off with a lyric about a mob boss being blown up along with his house in Philadelphia. After the sepia-toned nostalgia of "Mansion on the Hill", there\'s also "Johnny 99", a fast rock &amp;amp; roller (albeit played solo, like everything else, and on an acoustic guitar) about a guy who loses his job at an auto plant, can\'t find a new one, so he gets drunk one night and shoots a night clerk dead for no real reason. This is followed by a sweet country-folk ballad about Joe Roberts, an honest farmer-turned-highway patrolman from Michigan who finds out that his no-good brother is responsible for a shooting at a roadhouse, chases him through country roads and then knowingly "watches his tail lights disappear" near the Canadian border, because "man turns his back on his family, well he just ain\'t no good". All of this is front loaded into the first half of the album, and then at the beginning of side two (on the original vinyl) is its most frightening song, the ominous "State Trooper". This time, we don\'t know what this guy did, he\'s "got a clear conscience" about the things he\'s done, but he desperately wishes "please don\'t stop me", getting impatient with talk-show radio and saying he\'s got something that\'s been "botherin\' him (his) whole life". We never find out exactly what\'s going on here, but the seething, deathly quiet intensity of Springsteen\'s performance suggests nothing good, and the startling howl that distorts the hissing tape to its limit at the end of the song is likely to make you jump the first time you hear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As disturbing as all of this is, there are a few respites from the pile of corpses and unflinching despair that seem to haunt most of &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt;, especially its last few songs, like the Chuck Berry-esque "Open All Night", the one song that\'s powered by an electric rather than acoustic guitar, and the deeply personal ghostly visions of "My Father\'s House". "Reason to Believe" (not the often-covered Tim Hardin song) ends the album on what initially appears to be an almost reluctantly positive note, a winding rumination where Springsteen doesn\'t even understand why people still find just that, all the time, whether it\'s a man poking a dead dog\'s eye as if it will bring it back to life, a submissive housewife still waiting for the man who ditched her long ago, or a groom waiting for a bride who ain\'t gonna show up. In the face of their undying faith, The Boss scoffs, and although it\'s not quite as sordid or anywhere near as violent as the opening title track, it closes out the album on a note that\'s ultimately just as bitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the next album would ultimately pull a drastic 180-degree turn on all of this, that album being the ultra-polished, ultra-mega-hit &lt;i&gt;Born in the U.S.A.&lt;/i&gt;, and the stark, spare gloom of &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt; would seemingly become a distant memory even for some of Bruce\'s most loyal fans. But with this much-loved anomaly in his discography, a sound which he has revisited on only a few occasions (1995\'s &lt;i&gt;Ghost of Tom Joad&lt;/i&gt;, for example) throughout his career, Springsteen had unknowingly presaged the advent of lo-fi indie rockers that would come to prominence in the later 80\'s and 90\'s, who would adopt his method of recording these would-be demos as an essential part of their musical aesthetic. This gives &lt;i&gt;Nebraska&lt;/i&gt; a certain context in rock history, but it\'s the strength of his songs, and the immense bravery he had to have in turning his back on the gleaming, uplifting rock sound that he\'d made his trademark, which make it possibly his finest work, and one of the best "mainstream" rock albums of the 1980\'s.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/bruce-springsteen-nebraska-1982.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Ek-xhm2tRiM/VgKtqaYfQ7I/AAAAAAAABGw/MBHTahyvbz8/s72-c/Bruce_Springsteen_-_Nebraska.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3148993261276495918</guid><pubdate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 00:44:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-20T17:45:54.489-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>John Lennon "Imagine" (1971)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-we3iKwSrLII/Vf9TOKdGHmI/AAAAAAAABF8/U2tfYe-tnrI/s1600/ImagineCover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-we3iKwSrLII/Vf9TOKdGHmI/AAAAAAAABF8/U2tfYe-tnrI/s1600/ImagineCover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band&lt;/i&gt; was a shockingly brave work, unlike any album that had come before it and still as harrowing and revealing as just about any rock record has ever been since it, it\'s no surprise that many listeners would be put off by its completely uncompromising aesthetic. With that same token, it\'s perhaps equally unsurprising that Lennon himself seemed to have felt it the right time to make something a lot more melodic and accessible, being as his first proper solo album stood on its own as a singular statement that he couldn\'t truly repeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1971\'s &lt;i&gt;Imagine&lt;/i&gt; was, inevitably, far more popular and more successful than its predecessor, with its title track of course becoming an instant standard that remains the most-covered song he ever wrote. Perhaps his audience, or the pop/rock audience in general, felt reassured by the song\'s ostensibly unironic idealism after Lennon had already declared that "the dream", presumably referring to that of the utopian sixties counterculture, was over in the previous album\'s "God". It was certainly a refreshingly sweet song, informed by socialist ideas of "no possessions", "no religion", "no countries" and "a brotherhood of man", that came out in an era of unprecedented social, racial and political division in the tumultuous aftermath of that turbulent decade. Those who take note of him singing "imagine no possessions" while being filmed playing his song in a lavish mansion, on a piano that must\'ve cost an absolute fortune, are right to point out how flawed some of the ideas in "Imagine" really are, but it takes nothing away from just what a gorgeous and ageless piece of music it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The album it opens is a far cry from the stark, deathly spare &lt;i&gt;Plastic Ono Band&lt;/i&gt;, boasting production and instrumentation that, at times, is nearly as lush and full-boded as The Beatles\' &lt;i&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Let It Be&lt;/i&gt;. But it does nothing to take away from its quality, as Lennon\'s songs are all superb; running the gamut from the delicate beauty of "Jealous Guy" and "How", which are as vulnerable and sincere as anything from &lt;i&gt;Plastic Ono Band,&lt;/i&gt; to the bitterly sarcastic "Crippled Inside", the McCartney-baiting "How Do You Sleep?", the hardscrabble blues-rock of "It\'s So Hard" and "I Don\'t Wanna Be a Soldier", and the rabble-rousing anger of "Gimme Some Truth". "Oh Yoko!" is surely one of the most joyous and infectious songs penned by a man in dedication to his wife, and it ends the album on a warm, fuzzy note, which is indeed in stark contrast to the despair of the previous album\'s "My Mummy\'s Dead". Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;Imagine&lt;/i&gt; isn\'t anywhere near as startling as &lt;i&gt;Plastic Ono Band&lt;/i&gt;, but it\'s no less great an album, and in hindsight, it\'s hard to tell which one of the two albums is really his finest solo effort.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/john-lennon-imagine-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-we3iKwSrLII/Vf9TOKdGHmI/AAAAAAAABF8/U2tfYe-tnrI/s72-c/ImagineCover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6226861940789675033</guid><pubdate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 04:34:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-10-23T21:43:43.567-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The United States of America "The United States of America" (1968)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NvFLMF849u0/Vf4jmJi8oWI/AAAAAAAABFA/dZJyR9ecUeg/s1600/MI0002016262.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="318" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NvFLMF849u0/Vf4jmJi8oWI/AAAAAAAABFA/dZJyR9ecUeg/s320/MI0002016262.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ignored by both Columbia Records\' marketing department and the general public at the time of its release in early 1968, The United States of America\'s only album represented one of the earliest and most ambitious forays into electronic music yet attempted by a rock group, recorded at a time when the only proper synthesizer available was the uber-expensive Robert Moog model and making extensive use of oscillators which were built specifically for the short-lived group by a fellow named Richard Durrett. Historically speaking, this album is perhaps most notable for being one of the very first rock albums, if not &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;first, that featured not one note of electric guitar in it, which almost guarantees that it remains an object of much fascination by aficionados of both experimental rock and psychedelic music, and it remains a deserved cult favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from their music, which was radically different from even what was considered cutting-edge rock of the time, and difficult for much of the late-60\'s rock audience to embrace &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt;, the band itself was a rather unusual grouping; leader/conceptualist Joseph Byrd was a former ethnomusicology instructor at UCLA, who was in his early thirties at the time he put together this outfit with vocalist and former lover Dorothy Moskowitz and several other UCLA students. They were schooled in the likes of Stockhausen and Cage, but were enamored with the rock &amp;amp; roll-fueled, leftist counterculture that shook the whole world in the 60\'s, resulting in music that was undoubtedly a product of its time, but also disconnected from the usual trappings of psych-rock or any other type of rock music as it was understood up to that time. It says a lot about how surprisingly willing major record companies were in those days to take chances that Columbia signed The United States of America, largely due to the good word of the label\'s ever-reliable rock &amp;amp; roll producer David Rubinson, when the group had played live just once beforehand, saying nothing of how deliberately anti-commercial they really were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"The American Metaphysical Circus" starts off with a burst of funhouse calliope music, which is gradually joined by four other tracks all playing at the same time to create a disorienting wall of seemingly unrelated pieces, then dissolves into an oceanic wash of eerie, space-age sounds and Moskowitz\'s heavily distorted vocal, a striking effect achieved by her singing into a ring modulator, which is just one of the devices that her voice is treated with throughout the album. Not that she\'s the only one who gets to sing lead; Byrd himself sings lead on four of the ten songs, although for some reason these songs tend to be the ones with lyrics that have not aged well, like the attempted Mad Magazine-style, "anti-bourgeois" satire of "I Won\'t Leave My Wooden Wife for You, Sugar" and the po-faced, self-serious Latin chant that begins "Where Is Yesterday". All of that aside, one gets the idea that it\'s a good thing the lead singer spot was primarily the domain of Dorothy Moskowitz, whose vibrant voice ranges from the Nico-like coo of the gorgeous "Cloud Song" and "Love Song for the Dead Che" to the Grace Slick-esque snarl of&amp;nbsp; the harder-charging "Garden of Earthly Delights" and "Hard Coming Love". Byrd\'s real contributions and talents lay elsewhere; the final two or so minutes of the album, for example, with an impressively complex collage of tape loops and excerpts culled from the previous nine songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His vision for this type of avant-rock, where the primitive electronic equipment is utilized in such an ear-prickling fashion as to make you forget there\'s no guitars to be found, was most certainly way ahead of his and the group\'s time, regardless of whether or not their songwriting was as exceptional as, say, Frank Zappa or Lou Reed. In the accepted history of challenging, unconventional music in general, The United States of America remain quite little-known, even in this age of exhumed obscurities-turned-forgotten masterpieces, and their one and only album is both underrated and under-recognized for how groundbreaking it really was for rock music in 1968.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-united-states-of-america-united.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NvFLMF849u0/Vf4jmJi8oWI/AAAAAAAABFA/dZJyR9ecUeg/s72-c/MI0002016262.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6043886255680068849</guid><pubdate>Sun, 20 Sep 2015 02:15:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-19T19:15:40.666-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>A Tribe Called Quest "The Low End Theory" (1991)</title><description>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V5A-SWzIPp0/Vf4H7s9mXTI/AAAAAAAABEY/C1zK6uCFnN8/s1600/MI0001719592.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="316" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V5A-SWzIPp0/Vf4H7s9mXTI/AAAAAAAABEY/C1zK6uCFnN8/s320/MI0001719592.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;1990\'s &lt;i&gt;People\'s Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm&lt;/i&gt; was one of the most distinctive debut albums by any hip-hop act of the music\'s first decade, but the ensuing &lt;i&gt;Low End Theory&lt;/i&gt; was even more self-assured and impressive, mixing A Tribe Called Quest\'s established social commentary and penchant for jazzy samples with slammin\' beats that often sound like they\'re coming from a drumkit as opposed to a drum machine, even though the group never used a percussionist. They did enlist the services of old-school jazz bassist Ron Carter for the sublime "Verses from the Abstract", though they achieve a similar upright bass sound (via sampling) in many other spots on their sophomore album. To this day, &lt;i&gt;The Low End Theory &lt;/i&gt;is one of the most successful jazz-rap hybrids ever waxed, successfully establishing a smoky, late-night vibe and taking full advantage of jazz music\'s broad, boundlessly eclectic range of sounds and melodies, as well as contributing a stellar set of cool, concise songs that encompass Q-Tip and Phife Dawg\'s impeccably smooth, near-telepathic flow and a broad range of subject matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rumbling, ominous "Excursions" functions as a statement of purpose for the group, as the lackadaisical Q-Tip casually recalls how his father, upon hearing the hip-hop his son was enamored with, was reminded of bebop. From there, he and the (slightly brasher) Dawg never sound less than fully confident on the mic, without undue posturing or any of the sexism and homophobia that permeated the lyrics of the West Coast gangsta rappers that were just beginning to take over the rap music world then. It\'s ironic, then, that Tribe once cited N.W.A.\'s &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton&lt;/i&gt; as an influence on the making of their second album, but at the same time it\'s surprisingly understandable, given that &lt;i&gt;The Low End Theory&lt;/i&gt; has harder-hitting beats and ever so slightly more adrenaline than most other records by members of the so-called Native Tongues collective. The music is stripped-down, relying far more on an incredibly strong rhythm section than on any of the samples that are present in the mix, which was notably something of a departure from the norm for an East Coast act in an era that was dominated by the dizzying, kaleidoscopic aesthetic of Public Enemy and (fellow Natives) De La Soul. There\'s no filler material in the form of skits or an overriding conceptual arc, just fourteen songs that are all chock-filled with cerebral, wordy rhymes, which take aim at the rap music game ("Show Business", "Rap Promoter"), ask a head-spinning array of rhetorical questions ("What?"), tackle an issue that\'s still very rarely discussed among rappers ("The Infamous Date Rape"), and plenty of other heady topics without ever sounding preachy or sanctimonious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fusion of jazz and rap music is like bread and butter on paper, being as both forms of music constitute indigenous African-American art and value both improvisation and, in one form or another, flow. However, few acts out of the jazz-rap movement that sprung up in the early 90\'s got the feeling and the music down so well as A Tribe Called Quest did here, and &lt;i&gt;The Low End Theory&lt;/i&gt; is not only unquestionably their finest hour, not to mention probably the best album this side of De La\'s &lt;i&gt;3 Feet High and Rising&lt;/i&gt; ever to come from any Native Tongues group, but also one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop recordings of all time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/a-tribe-called-quest-low-end-theory-1991.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V5A-SWzIPp0/Vf4H7s9mXTI/AAAAAAAABEY/C1zK6uCFnN8/s72-c/MI0001719592.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4639234991503282394</guid><pubdate>Sat, 19 Sep 2015 04:22:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-18T21:22:31.952-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Ice Cube "Death Certificate" (1991)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wbcppYc0Rk/VfyB_Qlbk5I/AAAAAAAABDs/Aty1f-fedxA/s1600/330px-Ice_Cube-Death_Certificate_%2528album_cover%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wbcppYc0Rk/VfyB_Qlbk5I/AAAAAAAABDs/Aty1f-fedxA/s320/330px-Ice_Cube-Death_Certificate_%2528album_cover%2529.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Ice Cube\'s solo debut proved many critics and fans wrong in establishing not only that the ex-N.W.A. member was a formidable talent on his own, but also that the group\'s unexpected star power rubbed off on him commercially when the album sold 95,000 copies in the first week of its release.

It incurred much controversy with far more overt misogyny than he\'d ever delved into before, as well as the newfound, unapologetic racism and antisemitism that surfaces elsewhere. Shocking, negligible lyrical content was all over &lt;i&gt;Most Wanted&lt;/i&gt;, and N.W.A.\'s &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton&lt;/i&gt; for that matter, but &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; considerably upped the ante on all of it, resulting in an absolutely unrelenting, prolonged firebomb directed at a multitude of targets, running through nearly every single song from the "oreo cookie"-baiting of "True to the Game" to the underage sex of the infectiously funky "Givin\' Up the Nappy Dugout", with its refrain of "I\'m gonna do my thing with your daughter" sung almost ironically by a chorus of soulful female vocalists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cube explains in the introductory "The Funeral" that the album is divided between "death" and "life" sides, the first of those basically being concerned with the problems blighting the black community, and the second essentially focusing on how the community can take action against them. On record, this translates into a first half dominated by imagery of STD\'s, dope-dealing, crushing poverty, racism and gang warfare, and the remainder detailing a mostly violent response to all of these things. Taken together, &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate &lt;/i&gt;has close to none of the sense of humor that popped up on its predecessor, replaced by an all-pervading, glowering anger that runs over the listener like a tank. This music sounds more genuinely dangerous than anything hip-hop had produced since &lt;i&gt;Compton&lt;/i&gt;. Needless to say, the relentless misogyny and hell-to-pay condemnation of those "oreo cookie" black men who sell out their race and try to be white, sprinkled with a dose of homophobia and antisemitism, can grow a bit tiresome at times, but through it all, Cube continues to be perhaps the best, most clever gangsta rapper and songwriter of all time. Like its predecessor, it\'s absolutely loaded with great songs, albeit without the Bomb Squad\'s production work and therefore less of the jarring sonic barrage that characterized the first record. Instead, it\'s all hard, deep-as-a-canyon funk, like a much more bleak precursor to Dr. Dre\'s game-changing &lt;i&gt;The Chronic&lt;/i&gt; with its heavy reliance on P-funk samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s only fitting that an album this provocative and inflammatory should come to an end with probably the best song on it, the scabrous "No Vaseline", where Cube viciously denounces his old homies from N.W.A. and takes the potshot at manager Jerry Heller that warrants the "antisemitism" tag mentioned in the laundry list of easily offensive lyrics. It may be a good deal less cerebral or thoughtful than the &lt;i&gt;AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted&lt;/i&gt;, but by any measure &lt;i&gt;Death Certificate&lt;/i&gt; is equally exceptional, and Cube would never come up with something as formidable as this ever again.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/ice-cube-death-certificate-1991.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wbcppYc0Rk/VfyB_Qlbk5I/AAAAAAAABDs/Aty1f-fedxA/s72-c/330px-Ice_Cube-Death_Certificate_%2528album_cover%2529.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-241379009241500810</guid><pubdate>Fri, 18 Sep 2015 21:27:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-18T14:27:08.861-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Ice Cube "AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted" (1990)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hwMVJa7Cc8c/VTMqO5dnHAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/y20DRRq9R8Y/s1600/AmeriKKKa%27s_Most_Wanted_(Ice_Cube).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hwMVJa7Cc8c/VTMqO5dnHAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/y20DRRq9R8Y/s1600/AmeriKKKa\'s_Most_Wanted_(Ice_Cube).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just as Niggaz With Attitude hit its stride as a most unexpected commercial entity, the one out of the fivesome who delivered the group\'s most unadulterated, aggressive rhymes left the group amid business disputes and struck out on his own with a vengeance in late 1989. Many had doubts about Ice Cube\'s solo clout, especially given that Eric "Eazy-E" Wright was pegged as N.W.A.\'s star character by much of the national media and the group\'s fans, but the blistering &lt;i&gt;AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;silenced most of the naysayers with a hard-hitting Bomb Squad production that bridges the George Clinton-derived sounds common to West Coast hip-hop and the dense, sample-heavy collage techniques that the production team had debuted with the East Coast\'s own Public Enemy. For good measure, it also boasted almost as much incendiary rhetoric as N.W.A.\'s &lt;i&gt;Straight Outta Compton, &lt;/i&gt;or for that matter PE\'s &lt;i&gt;Fear of a Black Planet &lt;/i&gt;(on which Cube made a guest appearance in "Burn Hollywood Burn"); after an intro bit where Cube plays a man about to be executed, he comes out of the chute like a bull with the vicious "Nigga You Love to Hate" ("Why more niggas in the pen than in college?"), and the attack doesn\'t let up until the album is through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the title track is a manifesto for a rapper who did indeed seem like a marked man in the first Bush era, and in an age where young black men undoubtedly served as the preeminent punching bag for the right-wing, white male power structure, thanks largely to an incessantly sensationalized crack cocaine epidemic, he was essentially positioning himself as AmeriKKKa\'s ultimate boogeyman. He fits the bill, and throughout his first (and probably best) solo album, he\'s waving it and his middle finger in the face of those who fear him and everything he represents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s far from an ideologically dense opus on par with &lt;i&gt;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Black Planet&lt;/i&gt;, as evidenced by the much-discussed misogynistic streak that runs through the album and the images of inner city violence that Cube portrays in never less than the crudest, rudest terms imaginable. In "Endangered Species", however, he attacks the dehumanization of black men, and in "Turn Off the Radio" he savages play-it-safe R&amp;amp;B DJ\'s with a damn-near infectious contempt. What\'s most important is how &lt;i&gt;AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;makes it perfectly clear that Cube was perhaps the most articulate "gangsta" rapper around, with even the mindless woman-abusing of "You Can\'t Fade Me" sketched out with undoubtedly clever turns of phrase. As a statement of purpose and a tour-de-force for one of the most intimidating MC\'s ever to rock the mic, &lt;i&gt;AmeriKKKa\'s Most Wanted &lt;/i&gt;is just about perfect, and on every level he would never truly top this incendiary debut. &lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/ice-cube-amerikkkas-most-wanted-1990.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hwMVJa7Cc8c/VTMqO5dnHAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/y20DRRq9R8Y/s72-c/AmeriKKKa\'s_Most_Wanted_(Ice_Cube).jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6321919150585816668</guid><pubdate>Fri, 11 Sep 2015 15:10:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-24T21:45:49.743-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan" (1963)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x0bcfNRtC0w/VfLcQCb6TsI/AAAAAAAABC4/Xbbs7mQg4YQ/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_The_Freewheelin%2527_Bob_Dylan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x0bcfNRtC0w/VfLcQCb6TsI/AAAAAAAABC4/Xbbs7mQg4YQ/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_The_Freewheelin%2527_Bob_Dylan.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With the hindsight of over half a century since University of Minnesota student Robert Zimmerman first began delving into traditional American folk song after being enamored with rock &amp;amp; roll as a high-schooler, soon becoming a fixture of the Dinkytown folk scene under the name Bob Dylan, it\'s clear where he began building his reputation as the most exceptional talent to emerge from the folk revival of the late 50\'s and early 60\'s. His eponymous 1962 debut album, a rather weak seller for Columbia Records that many in the recording industry at the time dubbed "(John) Hammond\'s Folly" and which contained only two original compositions, was clearly the work of a particularly unique and talented disciple of the likes of Woody Guthrie and Jesse Fuller. In light of what was to come just a few years later, it now looks almost like his first demo tape as opposed to a full-fledged debut album. It would instead be its 1963 follow-up which marked his true arrival into both the consciousness of a wider audience than the folk circles he\'d come up in, and into the framework of American pop culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was with the release of &lt;i&gt;The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt; that Bob Dylan was introduced to the world the way the world first got to know him, as the protest-singing troubadour who would soon be anointed as the "Voice of a Generation", that generation being made up of people in their early twenties who were against the militarism of the Cold War-era U.S. government, supported the ever-intensifying civil rights movement, and who would, by the end of the 60\'s, be at the forefront of one of the most pivotal time periods in American history. The protest folk movement of the time, which had an enormous presence on college campuses in the early 60\'s, constituted the first rumblings among young Americans that would eventually blossom into the new-leftist counterculture that shocked, titillated and left an indelible impact on American society. Although singers like Dylan\'s close friend and onetime lover Joan Baez and Phil Ochs beat him to the punch by either making their first recordings several years before his (Baez), or being far more sincere about political causes than he was even at this stage (Ochs), Dylan would be the only member of this loosely affiliated group of young singer-songwriters to retain a crucial and important position in American pop music at large for the remainder of the decade. With that in mind, &lt;i&gt;Freewheelin\'&lt;/i&gt; is not just Dylan\'s first great artistic breakthrough, not only perhaps the most startling long-player that any contemporary American folk singer had released up to that point, but also a tremendously prescient signpost for the substantial cultural shifts that were to occur over the next decade after its recording.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Track one, "Blowin\' in the Wind", was, of course, the first Dylan song that the vast majority of music listeners became familiar with, and the first of many songs he wrote in the 60\'s which would become bigger hits when recorded by other acts; Peter, Paul and Mary recorded a version that would be more commercially successful than Dylan\'s original recording and brought the 22-year-old singer/songwriter a great deal of national recognition. Even though Dylan would progress much farther, and very quickly, from its almost naive or sanctimonious idealism, it remains nothing short of one of the most enduring pop music standards of the 1960\'s. "Girl from the North Country", adapted in large part from the traditional "Scarborough Fair", would later be re-recorded as a duet with Johnny Cash for 1969\'s &lt;i&gt;Nashville Skyline&lt;/i&gt;, which is appropriate in that although it\'s primarily indebted to the traditional form of American folk ballad, it has something of a country &amp;amp; western air to it, or at least its lyrics. It\'s no surprise that a young, pre-outlaw Waylon Jennings would be one of the first artists to perform their own version of the song after Dylan\'s original, which can be heard on &lt;i&gt;The Restless Kid-Live at JD\'s&lt;/i&gt;. "Masters of War" is unquestionably one of the most vicious and unflinching protest songs, regardless of musical genre, ever written, wherein Dylan compares the conniving, war-mongering politicians of its title who "play with (his) world" to "Judas of old", hoping that their death will come soon and that he\'ll stand over their graves to make sure they\'re dead. It\'s one of the most powerful anti-war statements made by any artist in the years prior to the formal beginning of America\'s decade-long involvement with the Vietnam War, which would occur two years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As beautifully succinct and eloquently phrased as "Blowin\' in the Wind" is, "A Hard Rain\'s a-Gonna Fall" has more depth and complexity as a sociopolitical statement, but furthermore "Don\'t Think Twice, It\'s Alright" is an even better song, which, as Bob pointed out in comments quoted in the album\'s liner notes, seems at first like a tender romantic ballad, but it\'s really more of a good motto to keep to yourself if you\'re ever in doubt. The closing "I Shall Be Free", among other numbers here, demonstrates the surprisingly strong, absurdist sense of humor that would be unfortunately lacking in the ensuing &lt;i&gt;Times They Are-a Changin\'&lt;/i&gt; album, making a return in &lt;i&gt;Another Side of Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt; later in 1964.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan&lt;/i&gt; captures just the first phase of Dylan\'s long career as an ever-shapeshifting artistic force, but even with the triumphs of later albums like &lt;i&gt;Highway 61 Revisited &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Blonde on Blonde&lt;/i&gt;, it still holds up as one of his best and most consistent albums, and one of the best albums of the pre-Beatles era when, for the most part, LP\'s were merely collections of songs, as opposed to being considered artistic statements. Although it wasn\'t his first album, it\'s still startling to hear just how good a singer and songwriter he was, at the age of just 21 at the time of its recording, and how even before he officially turned his back on the trappings and political ideals of the folk movement, he was already in a much different league as a writer of original material at such an early stage.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/bob-dylan-freewheelin-bob-dylan-1963.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-x0bcfNRtC0w/VfLcQCb6TsI/AAAAAAAABC4/Xbbs7mQg4YQ/s72-c/Bob_Dylan_-_The_Freewheelin%2527_Bob_Dylan.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1370247184930098018</guid><pubdate>Thu, 03 Sep 2015 22:02:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-09-03T17:02:56.152-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Rolling Stones "Beggars Banquet" (1968)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vxPxOilyPqY/VejEHHqMGnI/AAAAAAAABBs/1mdaTqB0ZKM/s1600/MI0000367339.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vxPxOilyPqY/VejEHHqMGnI/AAAAAAAABBs/1mdaTqB0ZKM/s320/MI0000367339.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Stones spent 1967 experimenting with Kinks-esque British pop and psychedelia on the superb &lt;i&gt;Between the Buttons &lt;/i&gt;and the fascinating yet more flawed &lt;i&gt;Their Satanic Majesties Request&lt;/i&gt;. As Keith Richards tells it, he\'d been listening to a veritable collection of records that he\'d picked up on jaunts to America in the mid-60\'s, but never had time to listen to until their touring slowed way down in 1967 and \'68, and the sounds of American roots music would inform the back-to-basics &lt;i&gt;Beggars Banquet &lt;/i&gt;album. A troubled Brian Jones was largely absent from the studio when work began on their seventh British (and ninth American) album in March 1968, which is part of the reason that it has far less of their experimentation of the past couple of years. Some at the time might\'ve grumbled that The Stones were copping out of the increasingly progressive rock vanguard of the late 60\'s by going back to the roots of their music, but from beginning to end, &lt;i&gt;Beggars Banquet &lt;/i&gt;was the strongest album statement the group had yet produced, beginning a startling string of classic albums that would continue with 1969\'s apocalyptic &lt;i&gt;Let It Bleed&lt;/i&gt;, 1971\'s hungover &lt;i&gt;Sticky Fingers&lt;/i&gt;, and 1972\'s ragged masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Exile on Main St.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unorthodox arrangements certainly were not gone from the band\'s musical character at this stage, as demonstrated by the six-plus minute epic "Sympathy for the Devil", which is the perfect calling card for the sinister elements that would run through everything they made thereafter up to &lt;i&gt;Exile&lt;/i&gt;; The Stones had certainly been controversial before, with their well-earned bad boy image and the lasciviousness of songs like "Let\'s Spend the Night Together" and "Satisfaction", but flirting with the image of Lucifer suggested a new kind of danger and malevolence that went hand-in-hand with the disintegration of late 60\'s "flower power". It\'s rather interesting in hindsight that it opens the same album that also features the ostensibly revolutionary, summer-of-\'68 anthem "Street Fighting Man", which is actually more in step with the position of John Lennon\'s "Revolution" than one might expect when you scan its lyrics. In any case, "Sympathy" is far more prescient not just for the future direction of The Rolling Stones, but also for the direction rock &amp;amp; roll itself would take in the 1970\'s, when bands like Led Zeppelin and Grand Funk Railroad got heavier and nastier, and hedonistic decadence took center stage in hard rock. The leering "Stray Cat Blues" considerably upped the ante on the sexual sleaze that had always been a crucial part of The Stones\' persona, where Mick Jagger is coming onto a fifteen-year-old groupie, shrugging that "it\'s no hanging matter/it\'s no capital crime" and that "I\'ll bet your mama don\'t know you can bite like that/I\'ll bet she never saw you scratch my back". It\'s one of the few songs, from the time when rock could actually shock people, that would actually be considered far &lt;i&gt;more &lt;/i&gt;offensive and/or outrageous if it were released today than it was at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By contrast to all this, looking through that same retrospective lens, "No Expectations" is perhaps the saddest and loneliest song Jagger or Richards ever penned; it certainly wasn\'t intended as such, but with Jones\' lonesome slide guitar part, it sounds like an elegy in advance of his tragic death, which would occur just about a year after the recording of the album wrapped up. The song\'s very first live performance, which was filmed for the then-unreleased "Rock &amp;amp; Roll Circus" TV film in December of 1968, would represent Jones\' very last performance with the group he named and helped form. "Take me to the station/Put me on a train/I\'ve got no expectations/To pass through here again"...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More consistent than any LP that they had done beforehand, &lt;i&gt;Beggars Banquet&lt;/i&gt; signaled the dawning of a new era for The Stones, one that would produce their greatest albums and some of their finest songs, and its first installment would forever remain one of their finest accomplishments on record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/09/the-rolling-stones.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vxPxOilyPqY/VejEHHqMGnI/AAAAAAAABBs/1mdaTqB0ZKM/s72-c/MI0000367339.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7552180871423457878</guid><pubdate>Sun, 30 Aug 2015 01:59:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-29T19:11:19.657-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Clash "London Calling" (1979)</title><description>&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X5nIYRZSoqI/VeJNWxuPVCI/AAAAAAAABAo/KIUchIqafLU/s1600/TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X5nIYRZSoqI/VeJNWxuPVCI/AAAAAAAABAo/KIUchIqafLU/s1600/TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With 1978\'s &lt;i&gt;Give \'Em Enough Rope&lt;/i&gt;, The Clash first began to make significant inroads into the US rock audience, many of whom first got to see the group live when they embarked on the tour supporting their sophomore album. In the wake of the Pistols\' implosion, they were now officially the flagbearers for a waning punk movement in Britain, but at the end of the blighted 70\'s, they were in turmoil. They had parted ways with manager Bernie Rhodes, and as a consequence had to leave their longtime rehearsal studio in Camden Town to find a new place to brainstorm new music. In mid-1979, they holed up in a place called Vanilla Studios to write and demo new songs, before entering Wessex Studios in August to begin recording their third album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had already proven as early as their very first album, with the rocking-yet-reverent version of Junior Murvin\'s reggae classic "Police and Thieves", that unlike the Sex Pistols, they weren\'t confined to a basic 4/4 rock &amp;amp; roll sound, and by the time of their second LP, that basic punk-rock sound had been adopted by scores of derivative, dumbed-down groups in Britain. By 1979, for all intents and purposes, the original punk movement there (and the older scene for that matter in New York\'s CBGB\'s, for slightly different reasons, but at about the same time) had quickly frittered away in a veritable shitstorm of media hysteria and increasing commercial success. Nobody in The Clash ever really put it like this, but one can\'t help but think that this emboldened them to almost completely eschew the basic sound and angry sloganeering of their early days, and embrace a thick gumbo of music that was still filtered through the urgency and immediacy of punk rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Produced by the volatile Guy Stevens, as opposed to the previous album\'s slick and professional Sandy Pearlman, &lt;i&gt;London Calling&lt;/i&gt; is nothing short of a tour de force, as admittedly tired and universally-acknowledged a statement as that is to make about &lt;i&gt;London Calling &lt;/i&gt;by now. The very first double-album of the post-punk era, there is absolutely none of the paltry filler material that significantly hampered &lt;i&gt;Give \'Em Enough Rope&lt;/i&gt;, and it kicks right off with one of the absolute greatest album openers in rock history. The ominous title track is nothing short of an apocalyptic siren, Joe Strummer\'s warning to all whose ears are open that the "phony Beatlemania" and placid idealism of the 60\'s is long extinct, and he\'s howling it with more fire and desperation than any number of other punk groups who\'d been making similar statements for the past three or four years by that point. It\'s a particularly potent lyric especially when the album\'s UK and US release dates are taken into consideration: in Britain, it was released on 14 December, 1979, at the very end of the poverty-stricken, grim decade which the Pistols and The Clash were such an insolent, disorderly product of, and the end of the year when Margaret Thatcher was elected Prime Minister, foreshadowing yet another decade of economic and social turbulence in the country. In America, it was released a few weeks later, in early January 1980, ten months before the election of the similarly onerous, ultraconservative Ronald Reagan as president, the beginning of one of the most influential and divisive administrations in US political history, and with it a gradual erosion of the liberal thinking that the social upheavals of the 60\'s had engendered on the nation. "London Calling" could hardly have been recorded at a more appropriate time, as the opening number on what is at once the last great album of the 1970\'s and the first great album of the 80\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On side one alone, in vinyl terms, they move from the razor-sharp martial stomp of the title song, to the careening rock &amp;amp; roll of Vince Taylor\'s 50\'s oldie "Brand New Cadillac", to the evasive career criminal of the languid, weary "Jimmy Jazz", the unrepentant dope fiend of the rampaging "Hateful", and the happily hedonistic rude boy of "Rudie Can\'t Fail". The wildly eclectic sounds are positively intoxicating through those first five songs alone, and then there\'s the rest of its first half; the ebullient "Spanish Bombs" sounds like it was plucked off of Spector\'s assembly line, only tied together with a fiercely political lyric, and with the disco-fevered "Lost in the Supermarket" the group reach a new plateau of lyrical maturity, as Mick Jones sings with a mixture of sympathy and scorn Strummer\'s portrait of Jones\' own childhood in the dreary suburbs. It\'s at once the most vulnerable song they\'d written up to that point, and one of their greatest slices of acerbic social commentary. With the furious "Clampdown", as with the title track, they pull off the neat feat of writing another one of their patented anti-establishment anthems without reverting back to the sound of early rabble-rousers like "Garageland" or "Career Opportunities", rocking in a way that no one but them could with an angry, impassioned call for their audience to resist the pull of the \'adult\' world\'s compromises and lost motivation. Bassist Paul Simonon takes the lead with "The Guns of Brixton", with the grim question of "When they kick at your front door, how you gonna come?/With your hands on your head, or on the trigger of your gun?" It\'s even more ominous than "London Calling", in light of the racially-motivated rioting that would take place not long after its recording in Brixton, among other areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the heroin-addled Sid Vicious died just as everybody expected, checking out at the age of 21 before he could face trial for supposedly murdering his repulsive girlfriend in a drugged-out stupor, a 27-year-old Joe Strummer lashed out at this mindless nihilism that was so commonly associated with punk, with the uplifting "Death or Glory". You know a guy is a gifted songwriter when he writes something like "He who fucks nuns will later join the church"! Although disc two is inevitably, ever so slightly less strong than the first one, nothing on it drags and everything only further fleshes out the album\'s ambitious wealth of diverse material. It wasn\'t originally supposed to be on the album, added at the last minute to the end of it and not originally listed on its sleeve, but everything perfectly culminates in "Train in Vain", the poppiest thing they\'d written yet, with an irrepressibly joyous lead vocal from Mick Jones married to a relentlessly catchy lyric about his own relationship with The Slits\' Viv Albertine. When released as a single in the US, it would be their first to enter the Top 30 there, buoyed by both widespread critical enthusiasm from the American press towards &lt;i&gt;London Calling&lt;/i&gt; as a whole and The Clash\'s growing visibility as "The Only Band That Matters".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether they really were or not, it\'s no wonder that &lt;i&gt;London Calling&lt;/i&gt; would attract such a tag for the group, because it\'s not only indisputably their finest hour, but it\'s also undoubtedly one of the greatest rock albums of all time. Of all the albums so frequently piled on with endless critical hosannas, few of them come so perfect and fully-formed as this one; quite simply, in terms of rock &amp;amp; roll, this is pretty much as good as it could ever get, and it has stood the test of time like only an elite group of the very best LP\'s of all time have ever been able to do, never mind the trappings of its era or any other in popular music history. It\'s wonderfully rich with creative freedom and a joyful celebration of music of all kinds, which is plainly obvious from beginning to end and is probably one of the biggest reasons that it\'s endured so well over a third of a century since it was recorded, and will continue to do so to whatever end this earth may have in the future.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-clash-london-calling-1979.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-X5nIYRZSoqI/VeJNWxuPVCI/AAAAAAAABAo/KIUchIqafLU/s72-c/TheClashLondonCallingalbumcover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-327158158727058894</guid><pubdate>Fri, 28 Aug 2015 02:33:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-27T19:33:33.448-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>X "Under the Big Black Sun" (1982)/"More Fun in the New World" (1983)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4b2XCIFsRk/Vd-3Ga9XTRI/AAAAAAAAA_0/8804HnJWjXE/s1600/330px-XUnderTheBlackSun.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4b2XCIFsRk/Vd-3Ga9XTRI/AAAAAAAAA_0/8804HnJWjXE/s320/330px-XUnderTheBlackSun.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In 1982, X did what almost no other band from the initial wave of punk rock in Los Angeles got to do, which is make the jump to a major label and go into the studio to make an album with major label money. It\'s no surprise that after putting out the terrific &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt; on Slash Records, the surprisingly widespread critical acclaim would reach the point where someone like Elektra Records would take notice, although one might speculate that it may have also had something to do with the fact that X\'s producer Ray Manzarek happened to have once been a member of one of Elektra\'s most successful acts. He returned back behind the boards for the group\'s Elektra debut, &lt;i&gt;Under the Big Black Sun&lt;/i&gt;, and if a segment of their fanbase was surely crying "sellout!" and expecting a polished piece of watered-down crap, this record sure as hell wasn\'t it. In fact, it might actually be their finest hour, where the already versatile band essentially left the sartorial and social trappings of L.A. punk behind and continued to expand their musical palette. Whether it\'s true or not, it\'s no wonder that Exene Cervenka, for one, considers it to be X\'s best album, or at least her personal favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An absolutely ferocious opener "The Hungry Wolf", whose extremely low-budget music video actually garnered some notable airplay in the early days of MTV, is a Zeppelin-strength hard-rocker that was unlike anything they had done previously, an evocative likening of a romantic partnership to two restless animals roaming through life, living in the moment and never knowing what to expect. The preceding &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt; had a preoccupation with John Doe and Exene Cervenka\'s fractious real-life marriage, but although it certainly rears its head once more in songs like "Wolf" and "Riding With Mary", &lt;i&gt;Under the Big Black Sun&lt;/i&gt; is more haunted by grief, which also had its roots in real life. Cervenka\'s sister Mary had died in a car crash a couple of years previously, which is explicitly referred to by the title of "Riding With Mary", the anguish of the tear-stained torch song "Come Back to Me", and the despair of the hopelessly attached ghost in the throttling "Because I Do". Of course, the foursome\'s exquisite rendition of Leadbelly\'s "Dancing With Tears in My Eyes" is inevitably colored by this sadness, as well. It\'s rather surprising that X waited until their third album to record the punchy "Blue Spark", which by the bandmembers\' own account was actually the first song they ever played together, but it seems to fit in a whole lot better here than it would have on either of their first two records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although X were always a thoroughly American band, as evidenced by their fondness for American traditional music and disdain for the fashion-conscious London sensibility that many outside observers readily associated with \'punk rock\' at the time, "The Have Nots" is where they began to align themselves with a kind of rustic Americana sensibility that would come to the forefront in later years. A perfect closing number for X\'s strongest and most satisfying album, it\'s a moving hymn to America\'s legion of blue-collar barflies, the disenfranchised working class that was being marginalized more than ever by Reaganomics in the early 80\'s. With over thirty years\' hindsight, it also pulls of the neat trick of being a perfect lead-in to the lead-off track of their next album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mq3NS3FsCvQ/Vd-_uTVV5kI/AAAAAAAABAQ/z9mWjboIpWY/s1600/MI0002807688.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="312" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mq3NS3FsCvQ/Vd-_uTVV5kI/AAAAAAAABAQ/z9mWjboIpWY/s320/MI0002807688.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When looking at X\'s first four albums individually, you begin to see thematic threats that run through each one, even if none of them are strict \'concept albums\' per se. &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; was laden with imagery of&amp;nbsp; "Sex and Dying in High Society", &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt; found John Doe absconding with a "White Girl" (who, as an aside, has long been rumored to have been Germs bassist Lorna Doom), &lt;i&gt;Under the Big Black Sun &lt;/i&gt;was burdened by painful loss, and &lt;i&gt;More Fun in the New World&lt;/i&gt; is often given over to sharp commentary on Reagan\'s America. The anthemic opener "The New World" is as explicitly political as they had ever been; it\'s really like a direct continuation of the previous album\'s "The Have Nots". Where they had previously given their empathy to those for whom "dawn comes soon enough" and "it keeps getting sooner or later", they now spoke in the voice of one of those down-on-their-luck working men, irate that things were better "before they voted for what\'s-his-name" and that all the bars are closed, cause "they must be votin\' for a new president or somethin\'".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As good a song as it is, this undercurrent of disenchantment with the Reagan administration really reaches its full flower with the magnificent "I Must Not Think Bad Thoughts", which also includes a jab at the radio\'s early-80\'s preoccupation with "The Second British Invasion" and namechecks fellow American underground stalwarts the Minutemen, Flesh Eaters, D.O.A., Big Boys and Black Flag in the process, asking, "Will the last American band to get played on the radio please bring the flag?" Many had uneasy feelings about this kind of nationalistic sentiment, which wasn\'t at all dissimilar to the contemporary songs of mainstream, "heartland" rock superstars like Bruce Springsteen or John Cougar Mellencamp, but they certainly made it sound heartfelt and convincing as opposed to mindlessly jingoistic, in one of their greatest songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, &lt;i&gt;More Fun in the New World&lt;/i&gt; is definitely a shade weaker than the three fantastic records that came before it, but it certainly has its fair share of good-to-great songs, including the melodic rocker "True Love", the Stonesy strut of "Hot House" and the white-hot rock &amp;amp; roll of "Devil Doll". One would think that closing out with a funky, four-on-the-floor version of "True Love" would kill the album\'s momentum and considerably mar its overall quality, but the experiment actually pays off quite marvelously well given just how completely unexpected it was. Many folks still don\'t know that Billy Zoom actually had almost as strong an R&amp;amp;B background as he did rockabilly chops in the years before X\'s formation. &lt;i&gt;More Fun&lt;/i&gt; was the end of an era for X, their last album to be produced by Ray Manzarek, as the group would rather inexplicably pair up with heavy metal producer Michael Wagener for 1985\'s &lt;i&gt;Ain\'t Love Grand!&lt;/i&gt;, and though there would certainly be strong material scattered liberally throughout their subsequent albums, it was definitely the final installment of their most creatively fertile period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/x-under-big-black-sun-1982more-fun-in.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--4b2XCIFsRk/Vd-3Ga9XTRI/AAAAAAAAA_0/8804HnJWjXE/s72-c/330px-XUnderTheBlackSun.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1037652241461536359</guid><pubdate>Fri, 28 Aug 2015 01:16:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-27T18:16:14.993-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>X "Los Angeles" (1980)/"Wild Gift" (1981)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmVomnDYvOQ/Vd-mRbT5bxI/AAAAAAAAA_M/6FhdcKTDU5w/s1600/XLosAngeles.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmVomnDYvOQ/Vd-mRbT5bxI/AAAAAAAAA_M/6FhdcKTDU5w/s1600/XLosAngeles.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;L.A.\'s late-70\'s punk explosion, for the longest time, didn\'t get the critical kudos that was rewarded the bursts of rage and energy that blossomed in New York and London at the same time, even though the Los Angeles scene (and that of San Francisco, for that matter) was almost inarguably just as vibrant, exciting and intense as the other two primary hubs of punk rock in the genre\'s early days. One band, however, managed to transcend not only the stigma that was attached to the city it was formed in, but also the inherent musical limitations of punk rock in general, and was rewarded with heap-tons of much-deserved critical appraisal by the likes of Robert Christgau and Rolling Stone magazine. X made it clear with their 1978 debut single "Adult Books/We\'re Desperate" that they were the most artistically promising act amongst the many punk bands that formed in 1976 and \'77 in L.A. With 1980\'s &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt;, produced by ex-Doors keyboardist Ray Manzarek, they not only put forth a mission statement out to the wider rock world that they were a force to be reckoned with, but also perhaps defined the L.A. scene itself with its fractured post-Beat prose, and much in the same way that Manzarek\'s old group belied the paisley platitudes of the Age of Aquarius, its refusal to deny the seedy underbelly that had always lied underneath the glitz and glamour of Hollywood celebrityism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bassist/vocalist John Doe, his girlfriend Exene Cervenka, thirtysomething guitar wiz Billy Zoom and hard-hitting drummer D.J. Bonebrake all came from backgrounds quite at odds with the suburban discontent that was giving rise to the advent of hyper-speed L.A. hardcore when the band recorded their debut album. Zoom and Doe were children of the sixties who watched rock become increasingly bloated and corporate as the seventies dragged on, and their salvation finally came when they heard The Ramones and Patti Smith and realized that they wanted to join forces with the musical revolt of punk. Cervenka was a frustrated young poet who had never really sung before basically tagging along as a second vocalist with her boyfriend\'s new band, and Bonebrake&amp;nbsp; simply fit the bill of someone who could hit the snare drum hard. Although all nine songs on &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; are fueled by punk\'s aggression and energy, bits and pieces of other musics naturally crept in; Zoom\'s guitar was dripping with the twangy clip-clop of rockabilly, while Doe and Cervenka\'s unkempt harmony singing uncannily recalled Appalachian folk music. The result of all this were songs that were far more cerebral, poetic and intelligent than most other punk bands, and a sound that was entirely their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pure venom of "Your Phone\'s Off the Hook, But You\'re Not" scowls right out the gate, but "Johnny Hit and Run Pauline" is out-and-out disturbing, a detached portrait of a serial rapist powered by a drug that powers him to have sex, every hour, for 24 hours. It sounds like something William S. Burroughs would have written in "Naked Lunch", plastered onto a slice of positively feral, menacing rock &amp;amp; roll. X throws in a sped-up cover of The Doors\' "Soul Kitchen" for good measure, as their little tribute to the man behind the boards, who also contributes his distinctive organ work on songs like the appropriately queasy, slow-burning "Nausea". The title track, which had already been released as a single on Dangerhouse Records the year beforehand, would remain the group\'s nastiest character study, of an apparently real-life woman who "started to hate every nigger and Jew." "The Unheard Music", which would later provide the title to a fine documentary about the band, is perhaps the most mature and accomplished musicianship on the record, a mid-tempo rumination on a disenfranchised populace, "laughed out of the public eye". After all the darkness and decadence of the preceding eight songs, "The World\'s a Mess; It\'s in My Kiss" is nothing short of a celebratory finale, as rousing an album closer as any band could ever hope for and a perfect capper on what is surely one of the most audacious and accomplished rock debut albums ever recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sL7DewKzZFc/Vd-wDCiEQPI/AAAAAAAAA_g/5fh5nEtrx98/s1600/XWildGift.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sL7DewKzZFc/Vd-wDCiEQPI/AAAAAAAAA_g/5fh5nEtrx98/s1600/XWildGift.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With Ray Manzarek again behind the boards, 1981\'s &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt; builds on the strengths of &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; and winds up as an equally impressive album, a robust refutation of the "sophomore slump" that befalls many artists who put out a debut album as startlingly brilliant as X\'s. If their first record was infused with the urban desperation and sprawl of Los Angeles, the second one is something of a concept album about strained romance, inspired by the real-life romance between John Doe and Exene Cervenka, who had tied the knot in 1980 and would eventually divorce in 1985. But make no mistake; this is anything but a melodramatic, &lt;i&gt;Rumours&lt;/i&gt;-esque rock soap opera. X still possess all the firepower and versatility of &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt;, and spin out a collection of songs that amounts to a whole that is easily the equal of its predecessor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might seem that re-recording "Adult Books" and "We\'re Desperate", the two songs featured on their \'78 debut single, was the result of needing material to fill the album to capacity, but although the original recordings are superior, the versions here both tie well into the overarching theme of many newer songs on &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt;. Strong indications of infidelity suffuse the tightly-coiled tension of the superb "White Girl", which is probably the strongest song here, and Cervenka continually puts off a real conversation with her husband in "Some Other Time". All of this aside, however, this loose "concept" does not dominate every lyric line by any means, as they spit out the frenzied hobo fever dream of "Back 2 the Base" and the resolutely minimalist "I\'m Coming Over", the latter of which started life as a poem of Cervenka\'s that she\'d introduced to the band when they first came together. It\'s not quite as startling as its predecessor, but on the strength of these songs alone, X still sound as unique and at the top of their game as they ever would again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And there\'s no question that things would never be quite the same again, after releasing their second album for the then-indie Slash Records. The considerable critical attention garnered by their first two records soon facilitated a move to the major Elektra Records in 1982, something that most of their original L.A. punk contemporaries never had the opportunity to do. In that sense, &lt;i&gt;Wild Gift&lt;/i&gt; also functions as a fantastic summation of X\'s first half-decade as a band. They would never make another record quite like it again.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/x-los-angeles-1980wild-gift-1981.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-zmVomnDYvOQ/Vd-mRbT5bxI/AAAAAAAAA_M/6FhdcKTDU5w/s72-c/XLosAngeles.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1527786260479418251</guid><pubdate>Thu, 27 Aug 2015 10:36:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-27T03:36:59.958-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Wipers "Youth of America" (1981)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aS-d-2xy5H0/Vd7eUM2pY6I/AAAAAAAAA-0/gfPkgLOwbHM/s1600/Wipers_-_Youth_of_America.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aS-d-2xy5H0/Vd7eUM2pY6I/AAAAAAAAA-0/gfPkgLOwbHM/s1600/Wipers_-_Youth_of_America.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If the auspicious &lt;i&gt;Is This Real?&lt;/i&gt; immediately established that Greg Sage and the Wipers had a sound unlike any other punk rock band on either side of the Atlantic, 1981\'s follow-up &lt;i&gt;Youth of America&lt;/i&gt; was even more unique, branching out into more complex melodies and song structures while retaining the group\'s anthemic, scrappy energy and the angst-ridden themes of Sage\'s lyrics. At a time when most bands at the punk vanguard of the American underground were trying to strip the music down to its barest, most unrelenting essence, Sage (who for what it\'s worth was about 29 by the time of &lt;i&gt;Youth of America&lt;/i&gt;\'s release, much older than the era\'s hardcore kids) was pushing the sound and attitude in unprecedented new directions. His twangy, distorted guitar sound was already distinctive from the get-go, but here it\'s spitting out ever-more ambitious, spidery webs of harmonics, moving towards a kind of prog-punk that no one else was doing at the time. And yet most of the time, the rhythm section is still chugging along at the expected 4/4 pace behind all of this, grounding everything in impeccably tight, impressive songs. Everything is still in service of the song, and at just a brisk 30 minutes long, the album has not one tedious note or half-baked idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Taking Too Long" kicks things off and indicates off the bat that this is a very different album from its predecessor. Another thing that changed this time out is that after a bad experience with the professional studio in which &lt;i&gt;Is This Real?&lt;/i&gt; had been cut, Sage took full control of the sound and circumstances of the second album\'s recording. As a result, &lt;i&gt;Youth of America&lt;/i&gt; has a much darker, eerier atmosphere than the first album, and "Taking Too Long" is a perfect example, with Sage\'s whispered verses and the group\'s restraining of the trademark chug, not to mention a piano that complements the (just-on-the-verge-of) cathartic choruses. The soaring power-pop "Can This Be" is the sole reprise of their earlier, more conventionally melodic sound, and the dramatic, six-plus-minute "When It\'s Over" is a stunning capper to the album\'s first half. The closing title track is the most talked-about part of the record, clocking in at an unheard-of ten-and-a-half minutes, and it\'s still startling to listen to it pulsing on pure manic urgency all the way through, never losing momentum as Sage calls out "it is time we rectify this now!" to the alienated, disaffected kids that were always his primary thematic concern in those early Wipers songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although 1983\'s ensuing &lt;i&gt;Over the Edge&lt;/i&gt;, which brought them back down to the sleek, pounding pop-punk anthems of &lt;i&gt;Is This Real?&lt;/i&gt;, would be just as strong an album, &lt;i&gt;Youth of America&lt;/i&gt; is without a doubt the Wipers\' masterpiece, a stunningly impressive piece of work that sounded like absolutely no other record of its time and would continue to reverberate across the spectrum of American underground rock for years to come. It\'s a doggone shame that even after the acknowledgement of the Wipers\' massive influence on the Pacific Northwest grunge-rock that would blow up the charts a decade later, &lt;i&gt;Youth of America &lt;/i&gt;(and much of Sage\'s work, with or without the Wipers in general) is still often overlooked.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/wipers-youth-of-america-1981.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aS-d-2xy5H0/Vd7eUM2pY6I/AAAAAAAAA-0/gfPkgLOwbHM/s72-c/Wipers_-_Youth_of_America.png" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5100295336373510878</guid><pubdate>Fri, 14 Aug 2015 20:40:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-17T23:32:14.758-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Replacements "Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash" (1981)/"Stink" (1982)"Hootenanny" (1983)/"Let it Be" (1984)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NrMK1U5c21k/Vc1QmX6GRwI/AAAAAAAAA7M/baQrAcm7jbY/s1600/IMG_0347.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="239" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NrMK1U5c21k/Vc1QmX6GRwI/AAAAAAAAA7M/baQrAcm7jbY/s320/IMG_0347.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just picked up a copy of Rhino Entertainment\'s brand-new vinyl box set, which collects all four records The Replacements cut while on the Minnesota indie Twin/Tone. It\'s arrived at quite an interesting time, being as Paul Westerberg announced onstage at a concert of the reunited Replacements in June that it was to be their last show. It\'s obviously a fantastic coup for vinyl junkies everywhere to have these four records all in one box, after years of only being able to track down pricey individual copies of each of them, but it\'s also positively thrilling to hear them in this context, evolving from the drunk-punk snarl of their first album to the full-fledged masterwork &lt;i&gt;Let it Be&lt;/i&gt;, in the span of just three years no less. I was rather surprised to find out that I was the first person to buy a copy at the Record Collector, even though copies had only arrived about two days earlier. I thought, \'Shouldn\'t this thing be flying out of the store?\' These records (with the exception of the &lt;i&gt;Stink &lt;/i&gt;EP, which was recently reissued in standalone form) haven\'t been pressed on vinyl in over two decades, and one of them (1984\'s &lt;i&gt;Let it Be&lt;/i&gt;, their last for the label) happens to be one of the most widely beloved and critically acclaimed rock albums of the 80\'s. I\'ve seen old vinyl copies of it go for about the same price, on its own, as the cost of this entire set (about $80). But hey, maybe a few folks\'ll be swayed by a sweeping overview of all the material contained in this excellent, and much-needed set, which also doubles as an overview of the first phase in the career of a band who continue to be tremendously influential on any number of punk or alternative/indie rock artists to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5YPNcYfDOVI/Vc1W1tP-AqI/AAAAAAAAA7g/fOlpq1vbfSs/s1600/MI0001668088.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5YPNcYfDOVI/Vc1W1tP-AqI/AAAAAAAAA7g/fOlpq1vbfSs/s320/MI0001668088.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;From the very beginning, The Replacements were an anomaly in the American punk underground of the early 80\'s. Although their earliest material certainly bespeaks a desire to be a part of the hardcore scene, they always played too loose, too sloppy, and above all else too sloshed to really fit comfortably into a scene that quickly adopted a rather absurd set of \'rules\' and an ostensibly humorless outlook. Obviously, 1981\'s &lt;i&gt;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&lt;/i&gt; is the polar opposite of Minor Threat\'s contemporary song/manifesto "Straight Edge", but in addition to that, there\'s none of the teeth-gnashing rage of Black Flag or the Circle Jerks. And for that matter, the band didn\'t possess the dense, sheet-metal sonic assault of their fellow Minnesotans H\xc3\xbcsker D\xc3\xbc, with whom they had something of a friendly rivalry and who are namechecked in "Somethin\' to D\xc3\xbc", a highlight of this debut. The Replacements sounded like a good-old-fashioned rock &amp;amp; roll bar band, the differences being that this one was made up of a bunch of kids who were all hopped up on punk rock fury and cheap booze, and who couldn\'t play their instruments anywhere near as \'professionally\' as your average bar band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side one is a relentless series of pummeling rockers, kicking off with the absolutely ferocious, cheerfully reckless "Takin\' a Ride" and rampaging through songs about the joys of irresponsibility, a crush on the girl that works at the store, getting bored with the bad weed one buys at an arena-rock show, and hating music cause it\'s "got too many notes". All spontaneous, unpretentious bursts of aggression concerning all manner of fleeting post-adolescent gripes, and all of it is a whole lot of fun. Then, at the beginning of its second half, comes the downright shockingly midtempo ballad "Johnny\'s Gonna Die", which is like Westerberg is writing a letter of concern to Johnny Thunders, the legendary former New York Dolls guitarist who was actually enough of a substance-abusing fuck-up to warrant concern from this notoriously fucked-up quartet. And truth be told, it doesn\'t sound like &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; much of a wild departure, starting a trend that can be observed on all their Twin/Tone recordings where the \'Mats would regularly take stylistic detours, and rarely did it sound at all like they were trying to be musically diverse. Immediately afterward, they turn in another one of their fuck-up anthems, "Shiftless When Idle", and through yet more endlessly entertaining bursts of noise they manhandle until the record\'s over. Although the three other Replacements tended to have certain preferences for how the band should sound, Westerberg was clearly the type of songwriter who just liked what he liked; "Johnny\'s Gonna Die" was the first indication of that unwillingness to be tied down to any one sound that would manifest itself continuously in the remainder of his Replacements years, and beyond as a solo artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the group, and Westerberg in particular, would obviously mature light-years away from this initial sound, &lt;i&gt;Sorry Ma &lt;/i&gt;is as perfect an encapsulation of the untamed, untrained impulse to just rock out, with no overwrought political or social baggage to be found, as any band could ever hope to get on tape. And so they were off to a great start, and they were just getting started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--eyEOW34svA/Vc2yVd5n7eI/AAAAAAAAA74/HlHellM1O1M/s1600/MI0001792149.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="310" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/--eyEOW34svA/Vc2yVd5n7eI/AAAAAAAAA74/HlHellM1O1M/s320/MI0001792149.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&amp;nbsp;This \'82 EP, or perhaps something of a mini-album, is essentially an adjunct to &lt;i&gt;Sorry Ma&lt;/i&gt;, overflowing with drunken, reckless abandon and songs with titles like "Fuck School", "God Damn Job" and "Dope Smokin\' Moron". The only real difference here is that it has a much fuller, more assaulting sound than the first album, and that much of it approximates straight hardcore more accurately than its predecessor As even the cover of &lt;i&gt;Stink &lt;/i&gt;indicates off the bat, the opening anthem "Kids Don\'t Follow" is the obvious high point of these eight songs; it might even be better than most of the bona-fide anthems that appeared on the first album, but everything else is equally enjoyable, and the whole thing avoids overstaying its welcome at a brisk fifteen minutes long. Amid the raw rock &amp;amp; roll fury is one particularly atypical track, the moody, angst-ridden "Go". Even moreso than the earlier "Johnny\'s Gonna Die", this song explicitly points the way towards the band\'s introspective, emotionally complex future. Fun fact, about the recording of Minneapolis cops shutting down a show that appears at the beginning of the EP: the guy who you can hear yelling "Fuck you, man!" in the background is Dave Pirner, the future frontman of Soul Asylum, who were long considered the little brother band of Minneapolis heavyweights like the \'Mats until they eventually hit it big in the alt-rock rat race of the early 90\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciOryWRCxqI/Vc22QdA7_1I/AAAAAAAAA8I/WBq2a2MGe1s/s1600/MI0001662618.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="317" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciOryWRCxqI/Vc22QdA7_1I/AAAAAAAAA8I/WBq2a2MGe1s/s320/MI0001662618.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By the time 1983\'s &lt;i&gt;Hootenanny &lt;/i&gt;rolled around, a sizable portion of the American independent underground was growing increasingly frustrated with the predominance of strictly regimented hardcore punk, sowing the seeds of the wildly diverse "Amerindie" landscape that would flourish from the mid-80\'s onward. Unlike a lot of musicians and music fans at the time, The Replacements had never actually cared about whatever sonic limitations punk rock (hardcore or otherwise) put on itself. In that light, it\'s easy to see their second proper album as the moment where they gave up any pretense of trying to fit in with the hardcore scene, seeing that a substantially larger "alternative" audience was now more than willing to listen to a band that didn\'t restrict their playing to breakneck speed-riffage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, though, that\'s much too contrived and deliberate an idea when you listen to &lt;i&gt;Hootenanny&lt;/i&gt;; by all accounts, the group played the entire recording process off as a laugh, tossing out songs of all different types without much care, a ragbag of crazy notions thrown up in the air to see where they\'d land. In other words, it may be the most diverse collection of songs they\'d yet come up with, but &lt;i&gt;London Calling &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Sandanista!&lt;/i&gt; this ain\'t. The eclecticism never comes off as "ambitious", and the whole thing plays a lot differently than a famously sprawling work like the aforementioned Clash albums, or &lt;i&gt;The White Album&lt;/i&gt;, or H\xc3\xbcsker D\xc3\xbc\'s later &lt;i&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/i&gt;. The title track and sleeve art add up to one big piss-take of folk music, with the bandmembers swapping instruments for an inebriated, bluesy shuffle. That opening title track may not be the funniest parody or the most compelling slice of music you\'ll ever hear, but it perfectly sets the tone for an album that\'s truly all over the map, which in turn perfectly reflects the notoriously wayward, erratic nature of The Replacements\' live performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hellacious "Run It" and "You Lose" would fit in comfortably on their previous two releases, and Westerberg turns in yet another of his classic mid-tempo rock anthems with "Color Me Impressed", while the jaunty rockabilly of "Take Me Down to the Hospital" is another fine showcase for The Replacements\' often overlooked aptitude as a bloozy boogie band, a particular proclivity which would soon all but disappear from their musical character. A couple of these songs don\'t really sound anything like anything else they\'d later do, most notably "Willpower", a downright ominous, moody track with Westerberg\'s vocals drowning in a pool of almost dub-like echo. No one on the planet earth would\'ve expected these rowdy boys to come up with something that The Cure might do, but the real standout here just might be "Within Your Reach", which is even more startlingly atypical. Westerberg plays all the instruments here, a drum machine (!) and synth (!!) accompanying sparse electric guitar, and on top of this most unusual backdrop is the most personal, vulnerable lyric he\'d put on a \'Mats album yet. It\'s the kind of wounded, heartfelt song he would perfect several times over, which eventually became the songwriter\'s primary focus, and here was its earliest manifestation. Many other tracks are given over to odd, amusing toss-offs like the haphazard Beatles/Chubby Checker pastiche/pisstake "Mr. Whirly" and "Lovelines", where Westerberg reads saucy personal ads from the newspaper over a sleazy mock-jazz backing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all closes out with the country-fried "Treatment Bound", a fantastically grumpy tune about "gettin\' nowhere, quick as we know how", in terms of popularity. In hindsight, it\'s quite an ironic cap-off. As uneven as it obviously is, the album was a crucial turning point for the band, both in terms of their music and their national popularity; &lt;i&gt;Hootenanny &lt;/i&gt;was their first release to garner any widespread attention from college radio, and it led to their first proper national tour in mid-\'83. The seamless wild-card sound and the increased critical attention would set the stage for their true artistic breakthrough, which, unbeknownst to anyone at the time, would eventually hasten the end of their Twin/Tone years and grease the wheels on the expressway to their signing with Warner Bros. Records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NOJo5UY9v-Y/Vc5Bo9H4i2I/AAAAAAAAA8g/h-dUya2I-Fw/s1600/MI0002079514.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="310" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NOJo5UY9v-Y/Vc5Bo9H4i2I/AAAAAAAAA8g/h-dUya2I-Fw/s320/MI0002079514.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Hootenanny &lt;/i&gt;was a surprising, eccentric effort, pointing the way to a band that had a lot more to offer musically than most observers would\'ve guessed from &lt;i&gt;Sorry Ma &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Stink&lt;/i&gt;, 1984\'s damn-near-as-it perfect &lt;i&gt;Let it Be&lt;/i&gt; was a stunning fulfillment of all the promise that The Replacements and Westerberg as a songwriter had previously displayed. All of Westerberg\'s growth as a songwriter, the band\'s growth as musicians, and all of their cards both musically and aesthetically are summed up here. Songs like "Androgynous", "Sixteen Blue" and "Answering Machine" are the kind of things most songwriters would absolutely kill to be able to come up with, and here they sit with songs like "Gary\'s Got a Boner" and a speedy punk blast about the sixteen-year-old bass player having his tonsils removed. And all of it absolutely sounds like it was meant to be here, on the same album; part of its genius is how a song like "Androgynous" can be credibly sandwiched between "Tommy Gets His Tonsils Out" and a fine but far from essential cover of Kiss\' "Black Diamond". Because of this quality, this refusal to take everything so god-damned seriously even when baring the most vulnerable parts of their soul, &lt;i&gt;Let it Be &lt;/i&gt;is unique in the annals of classic, much-ballyhooed rock albums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1984 was nothing short of a landmark year for the burgeoning, worldwide alternative/indie rock underground, yielding other fantastic records like the Minutemen\'s &lt;i&gt;Double Nickels on the Dime&lt;/i&gt;, H\xc3\xbcsker D\xc3\xbc\'s &lt;i&gt;Zen Arcade&lt;/i&gt;, the Meat Puppets\' &lt;i&gt;II&lt;/i&gt;, R.E.M.\'s &lt;i&gt;Reckoning&lt;/i&gt;, The Smiths\' eponymous debut and Echo &amp;amp; the Bunnymen\'s &lt;i&gt;Ocean Rain&lt;/i&gt;. In true Replacements fashion, &lt;i&gt;Let it Be &lt;/i&gt;isn\'t comparable to any of those other albums. The frequently applied (and very much deserved) "masterpiece" tag will inevitably indicate a major, ambitious piece of work, but despite the unprecedented poetry of Westerberg\'s best songs here, it certainly doesn\'t feel like it was designed as any sort of grand statement. The jangly, buoyant pop of "I Will Dare", featuring an exquisite mandolin part from R.E.M.\'s Peter Buck, kicks things off with the most mature song the band had come up with up to that point, but they immediately follow it with the joyous Eddie Cochran-esque rocker "Favorite Thing", which may be a wide-eyed love song but also boasts the infectious refrain of "I don\'t give a single shit", showing that this bunch of rough-housing, hard-drinking malcontents hadn\'t outgrown their wild ways one bit. If they had, &lt;i&gt;Let it Be&lt;/i&gt; wouldn\'t be as beloved by so many people or be as uniquely relatable to succeeding generations of teenagers to the present day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he sang about being "Unsatisfied", about the pain, confusion and boredom of youth in "Sixteen Blue", and when he howled "I hate your answering machine" over only the sound of his own distorted electric guitar (not to mention loops of that faceless telephone operator giving pre-recorded directives), Paul Westerberg officially became one of rock &amp;amp; roll\'s true poets of alienation and disenchantment. Few other rock songwriters have ever been as painfully accurate about teenage growing pains, and what\'s more, fewer still have been able to render them in such a fashion that listeners can connect emotionally with the material long into their adulthood. As it would turn out later, his band wasn\'t always eager to follow along his path of introspective songwriting, but here they follow his lead with surprisingly restrained playing and just the right amount of sloppy charm. A mark of true greatness is when an album captures a peak in creativity as lightning in a bottle, and as unlikely as many would\'ve found it when they first stumbled onto a stage back in 1980, The Replacements would become one of the few bands of any era to successfully achieve that. For both band and lead singer alike, this would remain their finest hour, and there\'s a reason that it\'s still regarded as one of the greatest and most enduring rock albums of the 1980\'s, and for all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/the-replacements-sorry-ma-forgot-to.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-NrMK1U5c21k/Vc1QmX6GRwI/AAAAAAAAA7M/baQrAcm7jbY/s72-c/IMG_0347.JPG" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7602955945201656194</guid><pubdate>Sun, 02 Aug 2015 06:19:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-08-01T23:44:43.109-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Joy Division "Unknown Pleasures" (1979)/"Closer" (1980)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nxyetXT6fn0/Vb2A_dELziI/AAAAAAAAA4U/Vb-NrhlS2yc/s1600/330px-Unknown_Pleasures_Joy_Division_LP_sleeve.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="319" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nxyetXT6fn0/Vb2A_dELziI/AAAAAAAAA4U/Vb-NrhlS2yc/s320/330px-Unknown_Pleasures_Joy_Division_LP_sleeve.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Coming from a band that emerged from the gray, dreary landscape of Manchester, in a time before it was a notorious music mecca on par with London or Liverpool, it should come as little surprise that Joy Division\'s two proper albums sound like they came out of nothing that was happening in the aftermath of punk at the end of the 70\'s. Even in the creatively fertile, musically diverse post-punk era, the first of them, 1979\'s &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/i&gt;, sounded nothing like anything being made by Mancunian peers like The Fall or the Buzzcocks, or for that matter any other band in England or America. It has endured and continued to be a huge influence on new bands like few other records of its time, but no one has ever made anything quite like it in over a third of a century since its release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two albums, both released in the month of July at the beginning and end of a single 12-month period, form an astonishingly perfect arc in the trajectory of the doomed lead singer Ian Curtis, and as part one, &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures &lt;/i&gt;is a perfect document of a young band that had progressed in quick succession from the raw, yet cerebral, punk-rock precursor Warsaw into a more developed, dynamic sound that was entirely their own and would be enormously influential. Curtis\' lyrics are relentlessly grim and filled with psychic tumult, but despite the album\'s gloomy, spacious sonic atmosphere (courtesy of producer Martin Hannett), they seem to take a backseat here to the palpable energy and adventurousness of the band itself. The precise, Motorik drumming of Stephen Morris and Peter Hook\'s signature, melody-carrying bass lines are overlaid with Bernard Sumner\'s heavy riffing, from the deceptive warmth of the opening "Disorder"; the jittery epileptic dance of "She\'s Lost Control"; the rip-roaring stampede of "Interzone"; the death march of "Day of the Lords" and "I Remember Nothing". From beginning to end, this was the sound of the future, and folks have only recently begun to really catch up to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In light of Curtis\' suicide at the age of 23, just a year after these recordings were made, their debut album is above all else foreboding and suggestive of a troubled mind, never fully revealing the true nature of its darkness. His ghost haunts everything Joy Division ever did in hindsight, and this album in particular, as Kurt Cobain\'s suicide hangs over even Nirvana\'s least depressive songs and gives everything an ominous feel because of what would eventually transpire. One can imagine how mysterious and indeterminable it must\'ve seemed to those who heard it upon its release, before Curtis was anointed one of rock\'s quintessential tortured souls. He hadn\'t yet reached the bottom of his hole, but he had stumbled upon a unique gift for detailing despair with an inner-directed sense of rage and frustration, a quiet storm that was no easy fit with the external fury and sociopolitical rhetoric of punk, but supported by fantastically exciting music that was deeply indebted to punk\'s unbridled aggression. The end result of all this, despite some initial grumblings by bandmembers about Hannett\'s production work, is one of the great rock albums, for sure, and most definitely one of the very best and most auspicious debuts of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bi6JKsBGCTs/Vb2eQJb2vzI/AAAAAAAAA4o/ARxVJeUIGsI/s1600/330px-Joy_Division_Closer.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bi6JKsBGCTs/Vb2eQJb2vzI/AAAAAAAAA4o/ARxVJeUIGsI/s320/330px-Joy_Division_Closer.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Upon release as Factory Records\' very first long-player, &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/i&gt; was not a particularly big seller even by indie label standards and was not immediately recognized as the great, tremendously important work of art that it is. But throughout the remainder of 1979, Joy Division\'s profile steadily grew, as an increasingly numbered following of gray-overcoated fans latched onto the band and they began touring more. At the same time, the young life of Ian Curtis, who had obviously never been that much of a happy camper, really started to unravel, brought on by an ever-worsening case of epilepsy and an increasingly complicated romantic life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sense of shame and failure he\'d always been plagued by only increased as his medical condition progressed to where his \'fits\' became uncontrollable, and would even occur onstage as he was performing. Doctor\'s orders to lead a decidedly sedate and complacent life didn\'t jibe with the physically expressive lead singer of an exceptionally aggressive, intense band whose popularity was increasing at the dawn of the 80\'s. While his songwriting had always been startlingly dark and morose, it became much more overtly desperate and desolate in the songs Joy Division recorded for their second album in March 1980. If &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/i&gt; was the suggestion of a very troubled, disturbed creative mind, &lt;i&gt;Closer&lt;/i&gt; is a still-unsettling, vividly personal representation of that mind and the man\'s final descent into what he viewed as an inescapable and overarching despair, the closing denouement before the ultimate demise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Hannett once again behind the boards, the uncompromisingly harsh, brutally despondent &lt;i&gt;Closer&lt;/i&gt; is a much different affair from the ethereal, otherworldly omen of &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures&lt;/i&gt;, right from the start with the queasy chainsaw guitars and primal, tribal percussion of the opening "Atrocity Exhibition". Here, Curtis is describing a twisted theater of pain-as-entertainment, perhaps anticipating the scores of writers and fans who would try to figure him out forevermore, sending out to them his own personal invitation of "This is the way, step inside..." Then there\'s the synthpop of "Isolation", musically speaking a prescient foreshadowing of Steve Morris, Bernie Sumner and Pete Hook\'s imminent New Order future, where Curtis nakedly admits "I\'m ashamed of the things I\'ve been put through, I\'m ashamed of the person I am." Joy Division never rocked as hard or cut so incisively as in the savage "Colony", and the band\'s considerable growth as musicians comes to the forefront with the tension and not-quite-release of the masterfully understated "Heart and Soul". The surging, emotionally overwhelming "Twenty Four Hours" spells out his fruitless search for a rescue from the darkness in as plainspoken and exacting terms as he would ever manage: "Just for one moment, thought I\'d found my way/Destiny unfolded, I watched it slip away." This is the last stand of that earlier-mentioned internal rage and frustration, subsiding forever into the hopeless, soul-sucking abyss of "The Eternal", where he imagines his own funeral procession with little doubt that life is soon to imitate art for him. One would be hard-pressed to name a more devastating conclusion to most any album than the epochal "Decades"; the spectral, synthesizer-driven music is almost a sweet lullaby in comparison with some of the stuff that\'s been heard earlier, and then again also the backdrop of a bitter requiem for Curtis\' soon-to-be lost young life, and a loss of innocence in the overall ugliness of the outside world, one that the singer was now completely convinced he just couldn\'t exist in anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the annals of popular music, there aren\'t a whole lot of places you can go that are darker than where Joy Division took rock &amp;amp; roll on their two masterful albums, and in the deepest, darkest trench of rock history, Joy Division are on an artistic par with the likes of The Velvet Underground and The Doors in how they shaped this into some of the most compelling, striking and influential music of its time, and for all time. With all their doom and gloom, they were never corny or mawkishly maudlin; their high drama was not a bombastic embellishment, which was lost on a great many of the band\'s goth-rock progeny. As tempting as it is to view Ian Curtis as one of rock\'s great tortured geniuses, as he\'s been built up so convincingly to be ever since the day he hung himself in the early hours of May 18th, 1980, one would do well to remember the man as Stephen Morris once described him: "An ordinary bloke just like you or me, liked a bit of a laugh, liked a bit of a joke." This ordinary, working-class lad also just so happened to be one of the great singing poets of depression and desolation, who succumbed to mounting personal problems and cut short a life that could\'ve gone quite differently if he\'d just realized that even what seemed unendurable was in reality quite temporary. When you keep that in mind, and in spite of the cold, distant, mechanical sounds the group was synonymous with, the unshakeable humanity of Joy Division\'s rather small, damn-near-as-it perfect body of work fully reveals itself and becomes all the more extraordinary.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/08/joy-division-unknown-pleasures.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nxyetXT6fn0/Vb2A_dELziI/AAAAAAAAA4U/Vb-NrhlS2yc/s72-c/330px-Unknown_Pleasures_Joy_Division_LP_sleeve.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8441900201356423830</guid><pubdate>Fri, 24 Jul 2015 03:52:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-23T20:52:41.539-07:00</atom:updated><title>Sonic Youth "Sister" (1987)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pL_MhEkDv1c/VbGst3n1WmI/AAAAAAAAA14/RggmupXU0hI/s1600/MI0002799247.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="313" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pL_MhEkDv1c/VbGst3n1WmI/AAAAAAAAA14/RggmupXU0hI/s320/MI0002799247.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While it may have seemed that 1986\'s &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt; represented Sonic Youth\'s breakthrough in terms of their substantial growth as song composers and musicians, the stunning follow-up &lt;i&gt;Sister &lt;/i&gt;was nothing short of a Great Leap Forward moment, a seismic shift in the feel and cadence of their music that perhaps for the first time made them sound as much a great rock band as a great avant-garde project. Leaving behind the gloom and doom that hovered over &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sister &lt;/i&gt;crackles with excitement and brute force; not only does the record sound much warmer and more approachable than their previous recordings, on a pure sound level, the band sounds more relaxed and confident than ever before, like they know they can now merge rock and the avant-garde seamlessly like it was meant to be, and do it like no one else but them could. Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore continue to spit out sheets of white noise from their guitars, but the razor-sharp, concise song structures whip them into shape and make the abrasive noise only that much more bracing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had already proven with songs like "Expressway to Yr. Skull", the previous album\'s showstopping closer, that they were developing a unique gift for incorporating pop melody into their experimental music in a way that could, at the same time, produce earworm hooks and still manage not to sound at all like conventional pop-rock. But the idea had not yet produced a song as simultaneously memorable, yet completely left-field, as "Schizophrenia", which starts off with Thurston singing a solitary, amusing verse about his friend\'s crazy sister and sounding like the group\'s most straightforward song to date, before it soon divulges into a dissonant instrumental break. The basic melody returns, somewhat, but not the simple three-chord pattern of its earlier section, slowly morphing into a wash of droning, needling guitars, propulsive drums and ambient feedback without abandoning the key or the original melodic tangent of the song. All in all, it\'s the most impressive thing the group had come up with yet, and it\'s just the opening track on what was the most impressive album of their career to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sonic\'s earlier work had already proven that bassist Kim Gordon was as interesting and unique a songwriter as her then-husband Moore, but the clattering, ominous "Pacific Coast Highway", one of her two contributions to the record, boasts one of the most unsettling lyrics that any of the band\'s three songwriters (Ranaldo, Gordon and Moore) had ever penned, or ever would again. It\'s something of an anomaly on an album that showcases the group sounding a lot more upbeat than they had been beforehand, which is clearly illustrated by the unabashedly melodic rocker "Tuff Gnarl" and their blistering take on "Hotwire My Heart" (an old \'76 punk-era obscurity by the long-forgotten Frisco band Crime), not to mention the gossamer "Kotton Krown", the first time Gordon and Moore shared the lead vocals. As rewarding and powerful as the group could be when delving into the atmospheric darkness that informed their previous two albums, it made for a remarkably refreshing (and perhaps even necessary) change of pace when they cranked up the amps and kicked out the jams on &lt;i&gt;Sister&lt;/i&gt;. While all of their previous work contained at least a hint or two that this band was something special, this was the first time they made an out and out masterpiece, one of their only two albums that you can really say are perfect, and in hindsight it\'s remarkable to think that the other one of those two was just around the corner and would be an even greater artistic triumph.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/sonic-youth-sister-1987.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pL_MhEkDv1c/VbGst3n1WmI/AAAAAAAAA14/RggmupXU0hI/s72-c/MI0002799247.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7307938109887225752</guid><pubdate>Thu, 23 Jul 2015 22:45:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-23T15:45:33.838-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Sonic Youth "EVOL" (1986)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CVut-bzaoc/VbFQenA0kVI/AAAAAAAAA1k/2j7VEIu11sI/s1600/MI0000039821.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CVut-bzaoc/VbFQenA0kVI/AAAAAAAAA1k/2j7VEIu11sI/s320/MI0000039821.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising&lt;/i&gt;, Sonic Youth took their first steps toward making their avant-garde bursts of noise and feedback into proper song-form compositions. For 1986\'s &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt;, their first album for SST Records and the first to feature Steve Shelley on drums, the group were inhabiting the same eerie, mysterious atmosphere of its predecessor, but with far greater compositional focus. If &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon&lt;/i&gt; almost felt like one long piece at times, &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt; was most certainly a collection of songs, and a few of them are quite a bit better than the ones they\'d recorded previously. The addition of Shelley, who had once been the drummer of the wacked-out Michigan hardcore band Crucifucks, proved to play a huge role in making them a much tighter band than ever before, giving them greater dynamics and strengthening their overall performances. Where previous drummer Bob Bert had a rather caveman-like, trash-can percussion style that could occasionally sound a bit hollowed-out, Shelley was precise and lethal behind the kit, whether exploding into manic fills or tribally pounding those toms, and as uncompromisingly brutal as Sonic Youth had been before, this helped make them into a more visceral, physically powerful band.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising &lt;/i&gt;and the concurrently released "Flower" single certainly both had a hazy, dreamy feel, "Tom Violence" and especially "Shadow of a Doubt" feel much more like dreams (or nightmares) unto themselves, both in terms of the sound and the newly developed song structures. The latter is literally a&lt;i&gt;bout &lt;/i&gt;a dream, as Kim Gordon whispers its first lines "Met a stranger on a train/Bumped right into me/Swear I didn\'t mean it/Swear it wasn\'t meant to be"; there\'s no indication as to whether it\'s a good or bad dream, but "You kill me and I\'ll kill her" certainly gives one the impression that great violence lies underneath a layer of misremembered details and self-reassuring platitudes. Midway through this extraordinarily moody, evocative piece, the music explodes from the tense restraint of its verses, as Kim desperately shouts "No!/Swear it was just a dream!" over the clatter of sound, before returning to the eerie calm from whence it began and suddenly petering out. Elsewhere, the swirling, psychedelic "Green Light" and the epic closer "Expressway to Yr. Skull" (which is quite amusingly titled as "Madonna, Sean and Me" on the back cover, and "The Crucifixion of Sean Penn" on the lyrics sheet) bring the noisy, abrasive Sonic Youth closer to melodic pop than they\'d ever been, without losing one bit of their inherently challenging, no-wave heritage or sounding at all like conventional pop songs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This very unique dichotomy and distinctive sound, which is essentially introduced in full shape for the first time here on album #3, would become a well-known and oft-copied trademark by the time album #6 rolled around (1990\'s major-label debut &lt;i&gt;Goo&lt;/i&gt;, to be exact). But in 1986, it was absolutely unprecedented, and would be a tremendously important influence on the development of what was to become known as "alternative rock". Seeing as it also happens to simply be the best album they\'d made up to this point in their career, &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt; is nothing short of a landmark release for both the band and rock &amp;amp; roll in general. And to think that they were just getting started...</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/sonic-youth-evol-1986.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9CVut-bzaoc/VbFQenA0kVI/AAAAAAAAA1k/2j7VEIu11sI/s72-c/MI0000039821.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5785369484552888056</guid><pubdate>Fri, 17 Jul 2015 01:07:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-22T19:18:24.043-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Sonic Youth "Bad Moon Rising" (1985)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i6fEJXCCQXQ/VahFgooD5oI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/s166Ux2nQKA/s1600/330px-SonicYouthBadMoonRising.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i6fEJXCCQXQ/VahFgooD5oI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/s166Ux2nQKA/s320/330px-SonicYouthBadMoonRising.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Essentially a transitional album, 1985\'s &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising&lt;/i&gt; is one of Sonic Youth\'s most curious and unique outings. Nothing else in what was to become a very extensive discography would ever sound quite like it again. At this stage, they were very short on melody and "proper" song form, and long on treated instruments, ambient noise and atonal squall. They had not yet developed their distinctive avant-rock sound, the one that would make its initial appearance on their next album &lt;i&gt;EVOL &lt;/i&gt;and which they would expound on with the brilliant &lt;i&gt;Sister &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Daydream Nation&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With its near-total lack of conventional song structures, &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising&lt;/i&gt; is typical of that early phase. What makes it different from their previous two albums, though, aside from being a lot more dynamic than the skittering post-punk of their eponymous debut or the throttling brutality of &lt;i&gt;Confusion is Sex&lt;/i&gt;, is that it\'s actually something of a concept album about the dark, violent underbelly of America, conceived at a time in which the country was in turmoil thanks to Ronald Reagan\'s severely regressive socioeconomic policies, but its popular culture was in the middle of a particularly nationalistic phase. In other words, the catchphrase may have been "It\'s Morning in America", but coming from and looking at the desperate, dangerous, poverty-stricken New York City that birthed them, Sonic Youth couldn\'t help but point out that it was in fact well past midnight, even if they certainly weren\'t going to do it by shouting "Fuck Reagan!" over a bunch of 20-second thrash riffs, and by no means is it a "political" album. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it\'s true that their next three albums would undoubtedly be loaded with better and more surprising material, &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising&lt;/i&gt; is the best representation of the spooky, atmospheric side that their music always had. In its original form, eight songs mostly stitched together by dissonant instrumental segues, it plays like a hazy, foreboding dream, laden with mystery and ominous intent, laced with imagery of sex and death, because as Kim Gordon saw it, "America is really about death". A plangent guitar intro leads into the galloping "Brave Men Run", wherein Kim Gordon sings "Brave men run from me" like she\'s Lizzy Borden\'s murderous ghost, and then husband Thurston Moore takes the lead vocals with the droning dirge "Society is a Hole". The lengthy, hypnotic "I Love Her All the Time" is ostensibly Sonic\'s twisted version of a love song, but it actually belies a disturbing undercurrent of sexual dominance and submission, a theme which Gordon expounds on with the equally chilling "Ghost Bitch".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the album proper, the chain-link of distant, half-remembered nightmares is broken when "Justice is Might" fades out completely and the chaotic "Death Valley \'69" comes crashing in. A primordial duet between Moore and Lydia Lunch, it brings all of the album\'s mordant themes to a fiery culmination with a slithering, sexually-charged evocation of the Manson family murders. It\'s the closest thing to a real rock &amp;amp; roll song here, and when released as their very first 45 RPM single, it would be their first song to make an impression on college radio, pointing the way towards the equally somber but much more song-oriented &lt;i&gt;EVOL&lt;/i&gt; that was to follow. In the end, &lt;i&gt;Bad Moon Rising&lt;/i&gt; certainly isn\'t as flat-out astonishing as its three successors, either in its original form or with the four fine bonus tracks tacked onto the end as has been the case with all CD/digital issues since 1993. But it creates a forbidding, nocturnal tapestry of sound that the group never quite approached again, and would indeed remain perhaps their darkest, most overtly foreboding work, which amounts to one of the most conceptually interesting and unique records in what was to become quite a large discography.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/sonic-youth-bad-moon-rising-1985.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-i6fEJXCCQXQ/VahFgooD5oI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/s166Ux2nQKA/s72-c/330px-SonicYouthBadMoonRising.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1263253883637110086</guid><pubdate>Tue, 14 Jul 2015 18:34:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-14T11:37:55.799-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Buzzcocks "Singles Going Steady" (1979)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TkSOCN_3vVc/VaVPBsOKKrI/AAAAAAAAAz8/4-0QL0IvYi0/s1600/MI0000619095.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TkSOCN_3vVc/VaVPBsOKKrI/AAAAAAAAAz8/4-0QL0IvYi0/s320/MI0000619095.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While the Buzzcocks certainly managed several above-average long-players in their brief initial run from 1976 to 1980, the format in which they really excelled as one of the very best punk bands to come out of the United Kingdom (or anywhere else, really) was on a string of near-perfect, classic singles. All of them are collected, split between A-sides on the first side and B-sides on the second on the original vinyl, in &lt;i&gt;Singles Going Steady&lt;/i&gt;, which is easily one of the greatest singles or greatest-hits compilations ever assembled, and it actually plays much more like a \'proper\' album than a compilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LP leads off with the smashing "Orgasm Addict", a sneering holdover from the group\'s earliest days when they were fronted by Howard Devoto, but guitarist Pete Shelley\'s impeccable pop sense soon took hold when Devoto left on the eve of the release of the groundbreaking &lt;i&gt;Spiral Scratch &lt;/i&gt;EP, and it\'s evident in the power-pop classic "What Do I Get?" From there is the effervescent "I Don\'t Mind", "Love You More", and the mini-masterpiece "Ever Fallen in Love?", which is quite simply one of the greatest and most timeless songs to come out of the entire punk/new wave revolution and stands as the Buzzcocks\' finest moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might think a song of such stature would dwarf everything that follows, but don\'t be daft; even the lesser-known B-sides ("Whatever Happened To?", "Noise Annoys", "Just Lust", et cetera) are compelling slices of atomic pop music. Another one of them, "Why Can\'t I Touch It?", also reveals a neglected side of the band that one would never expect from the masters of post-punk pop. Clocking in at an astonishing six and a half-minutes, it\'s an obvious homage to the repetitive, hypnotic grooves of German avant-rockers Can, Shelley, as it turns out, having always adored Krautrock just as much as romantic pop. Slow, droning, ponderous, it actually manages not to sound inappropriate or at all out of place amidst the all-pervading rush of pop-punk bliss. No doubt, this has much to do with it being the penultimate track in sequence, and just before the closing "Something\'s Gone Wrong Again", which itself is much more menacing, snarling rock than the rest of the album. But it also speaks to how surprisingly diverse the band were, and how they were clearly never afraid to dig into other sonic pastures that had little to do with the sound that made them famous. In their own way, these last two atypical songs are, as a matter of fact, as good as any of the more well-known cuts here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If &lt;i&gt;Singles Going Steady &lt;/i&gt;feels more of a proper LP than just a compilation, then it would also have to be their best album, hands-down, and it has stood the test of time to become ultimately every bit as influential on countless successive waves of bands as &lt;i&gt;Never Mind the Bollocks&lt;/i&gt;, or the first Clash album, or anything by the Ramones for that matter. And not just on "punk" bands, either: everyone from The Fall to The Smiths to Nirvana, Green Day, Oasis and beyond owes a bit of gratitude to the dynamite music created by this classic quartet.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/buzzcocks-singles-going-steady-1979.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TkSOCN_3vVc/VaVPBsOKKrI/AAAAAAAAAz8/4-0QL0IvYi0/s72-c/MI0000619095.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3107772263921766491</guid><pubdate>Thu, 09 Jul 2015 00:27:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-08T17:27:56.110-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pink Floyd "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" (1967)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hre-V4QQej8/VZ2zFULf1xI/AAAAAAAAAy4/FOidEJgcvvU/s1600/PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hre-V4QQej8/VZ2zFULf1xI/AAAAAAAAAy4/FOidEJgcvvU/s1600/PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Pink Floyd\'s first album, and the only one to be recorded with the enigmatic Syd Barrett as their leader and primary songwriter, stands apart from the rest of the group\'s later discography in a way that few rock debuts do. When they emerged as part of a distinctly British psychedelic scene in the mid-60\'s, with unique sonic elements like Rick Wright\'s keyboards and Barrett\'s distinctive guitar sound, they were at once more menacing and boldly avant-garde than the majority of their British and American psychedelic counterparts, and on the other hand they weren\'t yet the space-rockers of contemporary yore. The Pink Floyd as heard here, and on their British hit singles "See Emily Play" and "Arnold Layne", is well and truly a different band from the one that would later create &lt;i&gt;Dark Side of the Moon&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wish You Were Here &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Wall&lt;/i&gt;, and not just because of the obvious swapping of Barrett for David Gilmour that occurred shortly after the release of &lt;i&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly every major rock &amp;amp; roll band had already begun to dip their toes into unprecedented sonic and lyrical territory by 1967, but the ominous outer-limits rumble of "Astronomy Domine" was something else entirely and sounded like just about nothing else that had come before it. It\'s definitely quite melodic and has audible roots in the otherworldly, echoing sound of early-60\'s&amp;nbsp; instrumental surf music, but it\'s also much eerier and creepier than most anything in the Top Ten of either the American or British pop charts at the time. The slightly more conventional "Lucifer Sam", whose rocking riff sounds a little like the old "Batman" TV theme, is another great example of the dichotomy between Syd Barrett\'s childlike whimsy and the ethereal noise created by the band and his guitar itself. 1966 and \'67 were banner years for rock albums boasting a single barrier-crashing, ten-plus-minute opus, and the epic instrumental "Interstellar Overdrive" might just be the very best one among that lot. It was the first recorded example of how the Floyd did more than nearly any other British band to pioneer the extended psychedelic "freakout"; it ends up sounding like a very lengthy version of something Dick Dale might have done in the early 60\'s, if he and his backing musicians had played much, much slower and included spooky organ work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strange confusion between cutesy psych-pop and the sheer lunacy that the group (and of course Barrett in particular) constantly hints at beneath the surface of the songs culminates in perhaps the wackiest song, "Bike", which seems like the Floyd\'s catchiest and most cheerfully inane number yet until it abruptly ends and enters into musique-concrete territory with a 90-second coda. This parade of complete randomness, and the album itself, concludes with what might well be the honking of diseased mallards. It\'s interesting to note that &lt;i&gt;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&lt;/i&gt; was recorded at EMI Studios at the same time The Beatles were doing their work on &lt;i&gt;Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band &lt;/i&gt;in the same place, and perhaps not coincidentally, both albums end with the music giving way to wacky sound effects. And so, &lt;i&gt;The Piper &lt;/i&gt;sounds from beginning to end like nothing the band would ever record again, and with that same token like absolutely nothing else around at the time of its release, one of the greatest and most inventive albums from an era in which the band had unbelievable competition in the innovation department of pop music.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/pink-floyd-piper-at-gates-of-dawn-1967.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Hre-V4QQej8/VZ2zFULf1xI/AAAAAAAAAy4/FOidEJgcvvU/s72-c/PinkFloyd-album-piperatthegatesofdawn_300.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6792179438095763278</guid><pubdate>Mon, 06 Jul 2015 05:59:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-05T23:02:29.265-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Todd Rundgren "Runt" (1970)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CxYq8MaA6Hk/VZoL-q_llhI/AAAAAAAAAxs/7YuZAUJaqnk/s1600/Rundgren_Runt_Cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CxYq8MaA6Hk/VZoL-q_llhI/AAAAAAAAAxs/7YuZAUJaqnk/s1600/Rundgren_Runt_Cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The story goes that Todd didn\'t feel ready to immediately become a full-fledged solo artist after the breakup of The Nazz, so he formed an ad-hoc band called Runt, with the brothers Hunt &amp;amp; Tony Sales supplying the rhythm section in what was to be the first of many memorable supporting roles alongside other rock icons in years to come, and released what is for all intents and purposes his first solo album as a self-titled effort under that name. It\'s no surprise at all that the album today is always repressed as a Todd Rundgren album, not by "Runt", because it really is the first salvo in what was to be a string of wholly individual artistic endeavors during the 70\'s, and there\'s nothing here that you could discern as being any more like a band than like a one-man undertaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of all this, &lt;i&gt;Runt&lt;/i&gt; is a formidable first outing for one of the most fiendishly brilliant, idiosyncratic figures in the rock &amp;amp; roll pantheon, if in hindsight it may seem like a mere teaser for the even better follow-up &lt;i&gt;The Ballad of Todd Rundgren &lt;/i&gt;or the ensuing tour de force &lt;i&gt;Something/Anything?&lt;/i&gt;. The opening "Broke Down and Busted" is a gritty blues-rocker that somewhat recalls his days in The Nazz, but tender ballads like "Believe in Me" and "Once Burned" are prime examples of the kind of vulnerable, introspective songwriting, very heavily influenced at this point by Laura Nyro and Carole King, which Rundgren felt he hadn\'t gotten the chance to fully explore in his previous group (interestingly, despite having cut the original version of the classic "Hello, It\'s Me", which represents possibly the apotheosis of this side of his musical character, with them). He would only continue to develop this style on his next album and the one after it,, but it\'s surprising in retrospect how well formed it was in this initial stage of his solo career. On the other hand, the goofy "I\'m in the Clique" established his knack for willfully strange, offbeat material. All in all, add in the handful of tough rockers and his fondness for soul &amp;amp; R&amp;amp;B and you wind up with a most uncannily fully-formed debut album, introducing just about all the tropes that would define his more accessible material as a solo performer for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most famous song here is undoubtedly "We Gotta Get You a Woman", his first real chart hit and definitely the album\'s best cut. The one other Rundgren trademark not previously mentioned which the album also introduced comes with the pure pop mini-suite "Baby Let\'s Swing", which began the penchant for medleys and pastiches either of his own compositions or cover songs that would pop up several times throughout his 70\'s output. Unfortunately, immediately afterward, the record loses its steam with the closing, much longer (nine-plus-minute, to be exact) "Birthday Carol", another suite but one which is far less engaging than the one before it. This big mistake is probably just about the only one he made here, and one which would thankfully not be made again the next time around. Otherwise, &lt;i&gt;Runt&lt;/i&gt; is the kind of album most singer/songwriters would kill to have as their very first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/todd-rundgren-runt-1970.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CxYq8MaA6Hk/VZoL-q_llhI/AAAAAAAAAxs/7YuZAUJaqnk/s72-c/Rundgren_Runt_Cover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6144200583438354862</guid><pubdate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 07:42:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-04T01:04:57.350-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Mothers of Invention "Freak Out!" (1966)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lyatWbWMtZE/VZeCYQTs_iI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/H8LPURMnEtI/s1600/FreakOut%2521.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lyatWbWMtZE/VZeCYQTs_iI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/H8LPURMnEtI/s1600/FreakOut%2521.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Like his close contemporary and onetime labelmate Lou Reed, Frank Zappa was a dyed-in-the-wool student of rock &amp;amp; roll, rhythm &amp;amp; blues, experimental music and free jazz when he formed The Mothers out of an earlier, Zappa-less group called the Soul Giants in Los Angeles, at the same time that Reed formed The Velvet Underground in New York in the mid-60\'s. Much unlike Reed, however, Zappa was both a skilled avant-garde composer and pop songwriter by this time, and under his direction, The Mothers (of Invention) were unlike any other rock band of their time when they made their debut on record with &lt;i&gt;Freak Out!&lt;/i&gt;, one of rock\'s very first double-albums, and suitably enough a record that sounded like absolutely nothing that preceded it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the album starts off with the incendiary rallying call "Hungry Freaks, Daddy", Zappa clearly distanced himself from what would become the youthful counterculture of the era, well before it even became known as "the counterculture" in the pop culture lexicon and before it was anywhere near as well-defined as it would become within a few years. Instead of leading a charge into teenage rebellion, Zappa wrote some of the most unusual and self-deprecating pop songs of the time to make up the first LP. Disc one alone could well be called a concept album unto itself about the emotional bankruptcy of contemporary teenybopper pop and the staid conventions of mainstream America. "You Didn\'t Try to Call Me", for example, is without a doubt one of the best pop-rock songs to have been recorded in 1966; it also happens to be a hysterically funny, sneering mockery of all the romantic melodrama and self-pity that was/is so predominant on teen-oriented Top 40 radio, then and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in the case of whatever the real modern equivalent to that long-dead Top 40 radio format would be now. Although a robust, lighthearted sense of humor is most evident on the surface, there\'s also a real and palpable nastiness to it that bubbles underneath just about all of the album\'s first half, and that\'s what makes these songs so entertaining and engaging. There\'s also the completely wacked-out, early psychedelic classic "Who Are the Brain Police?", which boasted sound effects that had never been heard on a rock record beforehand and would soon be popularized as part of the arsenal of Jimi Hendrix, who as it happens would actually be inspired by a performance of Zappa &amp;amp; the Mothers to experiment with the wah-wah pedal for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these doo-wop derived ditties wrap up at the end of disc one, the second half opens with the fiery "Trouble Every Day", which marks the only return to the sociopolitical overtones of "Hungry Freaks" and gives a detailed, acidic account of the 1965 Watts uprising. Then begins the bizarre "Help, I\'m a Rock", and at this point all notions of conventional pop music trappings are abandoned wholesale; Zappa\'s experimental leanings fully take hold with the almost entirely a-capella weirdness of "It Can\'t Happen Here" and the sound collage techniques of "Return of the Son of Monster Magnet", the latter of which takes up the entirety of side four on vinyl. Even with major rock artists like The Beatles beginning to dabble in avant-garde waters at the same time, nobody had ever shifted gears so dramatically like The Mothers of Invention did here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You often hear these days that a much-lauded, influential artist or album was "ahead of their/its time", and that\'s certainly true for both band and album alike in this case, but it really isn\'t enough to describe how completely and utterly unique they were in 1966. To call The Mothers ahead of their time seems to imply that the rest of rock eventually caught up with them, but that\'s hardly the case here, even considering the eventual flowering of progressive/art rock. There aren\'t a whole lot of albums of any kind of music where you can truly say there is absolutely no prior historical precedent for it, and &lt;i&gt;Freak Out!&lt;/i&gt; is in that very, &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;small group.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/the-mothers-of-invention-freak-out-1966.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lyatWbWMtZE/VZeCYQTs_iI/AAAAAAAAAxQ/H8LPURMnEtI/s72-c/FreakOut%2521.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1486921767119788076</guid><pubdate>Sat, 04 Jul 2015 05:54:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-03T22:54:50.332-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Alice Cooper "Love It to Death"/"Killer" (1971)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TzyEpqurkns/VZdn4Yn7sMI/AAAAAAAAAwo/8k7NVXcMmOQ/s1600/MI0002481205.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="318" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TzyEpqurkns/VZdn4Yn7sMI/AAAAAAAAAwo/8k7NVXcMmOQ/s320/MI0002481205.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By 1971, Vince Furnier and the original Alice Cooper band (before Vince officially became Alice unto himself, of course) had put out two records on Frank Zappa\'s Warner Bros.-affiliated Straight/Bizarre imprint, and both of them not only passed near-unnoticed, but neither of them were fully consistent or possessed of a unique, identifiable sound. When the up-and-coming producer Bob Ezrin got ahold of them to commandeer their third record, which was essentially a sink-or-swim undertaking in terms of the group being able to stay on Warner Bros., all of the elements that had been floating around on their first two LP\'s and which surfaced in their outrageous stage shows finally came together to make for a dynamic, immaculately constructed collection of songs. For one thing, Ezrin had the group chop down an unfocused jam they would work out called "I\'m Eighteen", and the stripped-down, menacing final version was a smash-hit on the charts when released as a single in November 1970, almost single-handedly putting Alice Cooper on the map.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love it to Death &lt;/i&gt;starts off with the propulsive "Caught in a Dream" and continues with "Eighteen" and the equally anthemic "Long Way to Go" before arriving at the creepy, Doors-influenced "Black Juju", a suitably theatrical psychedelic-horror opus that manages not to be needlessly indulgent or tediously overlong, or to stall the album\'s momentum coming at the end of side one of the original vinyl. The real mini-masterpiece here is the epic "Ballad of Dwight Fry", which began Alice\'s long-term fascination with mental illness and psychiatric hospitalization that he would continue to mine on his first solo album, &lt;i&gt;Welcome to My Nightmare&lt;/i&gt;, and on &lt;i&gt;From the Inside&lt;/i&gt;, another concept record which was actually an autobiographical account of his own hospital stay for acute alcoholism in the late 70\'s. Here, it was still the product of his own demented imagination, completely enveloping himself in the skin of his protagonist as he starts calmly explaining his two-week stay in the loony bin, and by the time it reaches its climax, he\'s desperately howling "I wanna get outta here!" over and over. Legend has it that Cooper actually wore a straightjacket when recording the vocal, and he has continually donned the jacket onstage to this day when performing the song along with a number of other tunes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The album marked the first time the evil Alice character really came to life on tape, and it began a string of solid, if at the time critically panned, and commercially successful albums with the original group that would continue until Cooper parted ways with the band in 1974 and embarked on a much more successful solo career. Capturing such a classic example of vaudevillian theater on record is certainly not an easy thing to do when so much of the impact is visual, but as Alice has said himself innumerable times, it wouldn\'t have been so powerful or so shocking to a whole generation of rockers if he didn\'t have the band\'s terrific (and surprisingly diverse) music to back it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyFZeJ6b5A8/VZdv4mrQjNI/AAAAAAAAAw8/_V4xVMJxAKc/s1600/MI0002323410.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="312" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZyFZeJ6b5A8/VZdv4mrQjNI/AAAAAAAAAw8/_V4xVMJxAKc/s320/MI0002323410.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The excellent &lt;i&gt;Love it to Death&lt;/i&gt; made for a crucial turning point in the career of a great rock act that nobody else looked or sounded quite like in the early 70\'s, but its follow-up &lt;i&gt;Killer &lt;/i&gt;is arguably an even better album, expanding on the sneering garage-rock, the grim humor, the surprisingly progressive side of the group\'s musical character and the Alice character itself all at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If "Caught in a Dream" and "I\'m Eighteen" started its predecessor off with a bang, &lt;i&gt;Killer &lt;/i&gt;boasts an even better one-two punch with the classic "Under My Wheels" and the melodic guitar pop of "Be My Lover", and much like the previous album it wastes little time in delving into artier (and lengthier) waters, this time with the espionage-themed, King Crimson-esque "Halo of Flies". In-between the recording &amp;amp; release of these two records, the band lost a good friend and one of their earliest supporters in Jim Morrison, and they pay tribute here with the startlingly somber, literate "Desperado", with its "killer and clown" gunslinger narrative rounding out nothing short of a short story in rock-song form.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They\'d already become notorious in the rock &amp;amp; roll world with the infamous "chicken incident" at a Toronto concert back in 1969, but with the epic "Dead Babies" they whipped up an even greater firestorm of controversy that followed them from home over to Great Britain, which tried to ban them from performing when they made their way across the pond for their first shows there following this album\'s release in late \'71. As shocking as it was, if his morality-police critics would\'ve taken time to actually listen to Alice\'s disturbing lyrics, they would\'ve found a morality play at work; he\'s chastising neglectful parents who let their "Little Betty" stumble upon and ingest momma\'s aspirin, lamenting that they "didn\'t want you anyway". It\'s a gripping, chilling performance from band and singer alike, and another prime example of how well the returning producer Ezrin was able to help the group bring their unprecedentedly theatrical stage show into their recordings. Altogether, with only &lt;i&gt;Billion Dollar Babies&lt;/i&gt; as the other chief contender, &lt;i&gt;Killer &lt;/i&gt;is arguably the original Alice Cooper band at their very best.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/alice-cooper-love-it-to-deathkiller-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-TzyEpqurkns/VZdn4Yn7sMI/AAAAAAAAAwo/8k7NVXcMmOQ/s72-c/MI0002481205.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5549021787163394015</guid><pubdate>Fri, 03 Jul 2015 01:00:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-07-02T18:00:45.660-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Love "Love" (1966)/"Da Capo" (1967)/"Forever Changes" (1967)</title><description>Over the past few decades, more and more listeners have discovered how criminal it is that in their heyday, one of the best bands of the late 60\'s could barely get arrested commercially. Arthur Lee and Love were just one of the many fine rock &amp;amp; roll bands formed in Los Angeles and San Francisco during the mid-60\'s, but they were of a particularly high caliber in that regard, and stood out especially for being one of rock\'s very first racially mixed bands. Their first three albums, which are essentially the only albums that wound up being made by the classic lineup, constitute a few of the best rock records of their time, particularly the epic masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/i&gt;, the original band\'s swan song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i9Xw2--Xvos/VZW_mkj0xNI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/EZkdnIO2KhE/s1600/MI0001979691.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="316" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i9Xw2--Xvos/VZW_mkj0xNI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/EZkdnIO2KhE/s320/MI0001979691.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In their early days, when they were regularly bringing down the house at homey L.A. clubs like Bido Lito\'s, Love\'s sound was essentially like a harder-rocking Byrds (for whom Love\'s own Bryan Maclean had once roadied) with Arthur Lee\'s quavering, Johnny Mathis-influenced lead vocals. They were a hard-rocking, R&amp;amp;B-inflected outfit, but they also made room for introspective folk-rock ballads, which would soon become the group\'s focus in addition to lush orchestral arrangements. You won\'t find anything like an orchestra on their eponymous 1966 debut, which uncorks itself with the relentless piledriver that is their version of Burt Bacharach\'s "My Little Red Book", a key proto-punk recording if there ever was one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The record crackles with garage-band firepower like none of its successors ever did, except in select moments, but unfortunately it ends up being a clear indicator that both Lee and Maclean had yet to fully develop their idiosyncratic songwriting talents, making for an ultimately spotty piece of work when taken as a whole, like many first albums are. The handful of exceptions includes Arthur\'s brooding folk-blues lament, "Signed D.C.", a genuinely disturbing, painfully stark meditation on heroin addiction which in \'66 surely must\'ve been one of the darkest songs yet recorded by a rock group. This was just before The Velvet Underground\'s "Heroin" was loosed upon the land in recorded form, remember, and some five years before John Prine\'s "Sam Stone". The promise of Arthur Lee and the band may not have been on full display here, but at least half of its follow-up would turn that around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ur_6DbZgZwY/VZXDnDtZIYI/AAAAAAAAAvg/std7tFrkvZE/s1600/MI0002938904.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ur_6DbZgZwY/VZXDnDtZIYI/AAAAAAAAAvg/std7tFrkvZE/s320/MI0002938904.jpg" width="310" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Sure, the cover of "My Little Red Book" was a fantastic opening track for Love\'s first album, but the astonishing Arthur Lee original "Stephanie Knows Who" managed to do it one better for the group\'s second long-player, 1967\'s &lt;i&gt;Da Capo&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Hitting a heady, unprecedented middle ground between rock &amp;amp; roll with all the ferocity of the early Who, jazz, harpsichords and a most unusual rising-falling, semi-operatic structure, it\'s the best original song the group had penned up to that point. But Lee isn\'t the only one of Love\'s two primary songwriters who\'s starting to really show his stuff here; right up next is Bryan Maclean\'s positively gorgeous "Orange Skies", which he supposedly wrote based on the melody of the guitar solo in The Byrds\' "Bells of Rhymney".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though &lt;i&gt;Da Capo &lt;/i&gt;is where Love found their true artistic muse, bringing in the elements of everything from bossa nova to classical music that made the group so unique (apart of course from their mixed-race membership) in L.A.\'s rock scene in the 60\'s, their hardest-rocking song actually appears here. The atomic-strength "Seven &amp;amp; Seven Is" is one of the most ferocious compositions of its era, one of the most viciously driving rock &amp;amp; roll songs yet recorded up to that point, the tune people are evoking when they call Love progenitors of punk rock. The plaintive "She Comes in Colors" is said to have inspired The Rolling Stones\' "She\'s a Rainbow", which appeared on that band\'s &lt;i&gt;Their Satanic Majesties Request &lt;/i&gt;later that year. All six songs on the record\'s first side are better, or at least more distinctive than anything the group had written for the first album, but the same can\'t be said for side two (of the original vinyl), which is just one "song" in the form of the painfully tedious 19-minute blues jam "Revelations". It, too, was allegedly borrowed by The Stones when they caught Love live in concert before any of their recordings had yet been made, and they supposedly recorded their own barrier-crashing opus "Goin\' Home" for &lt;i&gt;Aftermath &lt;/i&gt;in \'66 after being inspired by an early performance of "Revelations" onstage. As boring as their (substantially shorter, 11-minute) song ends up being as well, it happens to actually be a lot more engaging in comparison. One gets the feeling that it\'s something they used to work out onstage, and that it may well have been sizzling in their early days, but it passed its due date by the time the group made their second LP. There would certainly be nothing like it the next time around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--yUi2YFrF24/VZXLnv4nuNI/AAAAAAAAAv0/WjFKnC-kDj4/s1600/MI0000350762.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="318" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--yUi2YFrF24/VZXLnv4nuNI/AAAAAAAAAv0/WjFKnC-kDj4/s320/MI0000350762.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While the front half of &lt;i&gt;Da Capo &lt;/i&gt;was made up of Love\'s strongest material yet, and marked a substantial stylistic shift from a lot of the rather undistinguished folk and garage-rock originals they\'d come up with for the first record, the third album was, as they say, the Great Leap Forward. On &lt;i&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/i&gt;, released just ten months after its predecessor, Arthur Lee and Bryan Maclean\'s writing grew more abstract and evocative, and the songs were augmented with orchestration that manages to weave directly in with the group\'s own instruments and never smothers the rest of the sound.&amp;nbsp; The result of this artistic growth is nothing short of a masterpiece, in the truest sense of the word, something that would paradoxically be heralded in later years as one of the greatest albums of all time and at the same time help to break apart the original Love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cryptic and inscrutable though many of the songs may be, as evidenced by wordy, grandiose titles like "The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This", "A House Is Not a Motel" and "Maybe the People Would Be the Times or Between Clark &amp;amp; Hilldale", it amounts to something akin to a concept album concerning the burning societal tumult that lurked beneath the surface of the flower-power, peace-and-love aesthetic of their San Francisco and L.A. contemporaries. Many commentators have read it, with its somber, occasionally even grotesque imagery, as a prescient foretelling of the violent clashes between young people and the establishment that would take hold in cities across the world in the year following its creation, or the internal strife that began to come to the surface with the violence of the Manson Family or the Altamont Free Concert the year after that. Arthur Lee himself once said that at the time of the album\'s creation, he felt like he was about to die, for reasons that he didn\'t elaborate on, and that he thought his songs would constitute his last words to the world. All of this certainly lends a foreboding, yet often quite subtle, darkness to &lt;i&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/i&gt; that puts a different mark on it from most of 1967\'s other California-based, psychedelic landmarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opening the album with Maclean\'s beautiful "Alone Again Or" is in many ways an acknowledgement that he was just as valuable a composer and singer as Lee, even though there\'s only one other song here that was written/sung by Maclean. Lee\'s ominousness definitely takes center stage here, nonetheless; "The Red Telephone" begins with "Sitting on a hillside/Watching all the people die", which might be the most striking single lyric line on the entire album. Similarly, the fiery "Live and Let Live", which is one of the few moments where the blazing electric guitar of Love\'s earlier work makes a prominent appearance, starts off with "Oh the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal/There\'s a bluebird sitting on a branch/I guess I\'ll take my pistol/I\'ve got it in my hand/Because he\'s on my land". This line, meant to satirize and decry simple-minded violence in a most sensational manner, gained a good bit of irony after Lee was convicted of negligent discharge of a firearm and sent to prison close to 30 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, this is far from an entirely brooding, depressive piece of work; the bouncy, energetic "Bummer in the Summer", "Alone Again Or" and the unabashedly pretty "Good Humor Man" are all proof-positive of that. But Lee\'s epic, orchestral "You Set the Scene" ends the album with a number of bold statements about the chaotic state of the world in the immediate aftermath of the "Summer of Love": "There\'s a man who can\'t decide if he should fight for what his father thinks is right", "This is the only thing that I am sure of/And that\'s all that lives is gonna die" and finally, "Everything I\'ve seen needs rearranging/And for anyone who thinks it\'s strange/Then you should be the first to want to make this change/And for everyone who thinks that life is just a game/Do you like the part you\'re playing?" Most of the other psychedelic bands of the day made statements against the established social norms of their parents\' generation, but few put it in such open-ended, uncertain and yet direct terms. Whether it\'s a "concept album" in the conventional sense is definitely up for debate, but it seems that a recurring theme runs through these songs, particularly Arthur\'s, and that would be one of how the counterculture hadn\'t quite made for an overnight revolution, and might not end up changing the country or the world in quite the way many of its participants still hoped and believed it could in those halcyon days of 1967. In another sense, it\'s a vividly colorful summation of Los Angeles\' swinging 60\'s, the time and place Love was born in, and written just as it was coming to an end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/i&gt; spent ten weeks on the Billboard 200 and peaked at a pitiful #154, even though billboard advertisements emblazoned with its cover stood all over Los Angeles, and it was much more successful in England where it made it to #24. Regardless, it marked the end of the original Love, which had been on the verge of splitting up all throughout its recording. Arthur Lee kept the name, but the remainder of the group that made 1969\'s respectable follow-up &lt;i&gt;Four Sail&lt;/i&gt; was a different band altogether with all-unknown new members and a much different, heavier rock sound. Not that the original group, or most any band for that matter, could really follow up something as complete, conclusive and just about perfect as &lt;i&gt;Forever Changes&lt;/i&gt;, which stands on its own with the kind of legacy that only an elite class of the greatest, most influential and game-changing albums in pop music history have attained.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/07/love-love-1966da-capo-1967forever.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i9Xw2--Xvos/VZW_mkj0xNI/AAAAAAAAAvQ/EZkdnIO2KhE/s72-c/MI0001979691.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7952771030531385415</guid><pubdate>Tue, 30 Jun 2015 05:32:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-29T23:04:19.783-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "Blood on the Tracks" (1975)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGLo5hg8fY8/VZIhv47AD9I/AAAAAAAAAuw/AcmM8nD7Sos/s1600/MI0001462461.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="283" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGLo5hg8fY8/VZIhv47AD9I/AAAAAAAAAuw/AcmM8nD7Sos/s320/MI0001462461.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By 1974, Bob Dylan had been largely inactive and absent from the public eye for the better part of three years, with the exception of his soundtrack to the 1973 film "Pat Garrett &amp;amp; Billy the Kid" and the abysmal, completely incoherent &lt;i&gt;Dylan&lt;/i&gt;, but when he for all intents and purposes "came back", he did it in a big way. He reunited with The Band for the relaxed &lt;i&gt;Planet Waves&lt;/i&gt;, and then went on a critically lauded tour with them that was documented on the double live album &lt;i&gt;Before the Flood&lt;/i&gt;. With his profile again rising in the middle of a decade that had progressed so far with a number of critically lambasted missteps, he really surged back to the peak of his artistic powers with his most startling album in years, and the most intimately personal work he\'d ever created beforehand, or ever would again. &lt;i&gt;Blood on the Tracks&lt;/i&gt;, culled half-and-half from sessions conducted in New York in September and then in Minneapolis in December of 1974, certainly didn\'t mark a return to the fiery rock &amp;amp; roll of &lt;i&gt;Blonde on Blonde&lt;/i&gt;, but it was widely (and justly) hailed as his greatest album since that tour de force nearly a decade earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Dylan himself will attest, &lt;i&gt;Blood on the Tracks &lt;/i&gt;is hardly a \'confessional\' record in the mold of Joni Mitchell\'s &lt;i&gt;Blue &lt;/i&gt;or the early work of Jackson Browne or James Taylor; the riddles and allegories he\'s always employed to great effect are as much in evidence here as they are on any of his other albums, especially in the winding, lengthy "Lily, Rosemary &amp;amp; the Jack of Hearts". But "Tangled Up in Blue", "Simple Twist of Fate", "You\'re a Big Girl Now" and "If You See Her, Say Hello" are some of the most heartfelt and unabashedly emotional songs he\'s ever written, reflecting a time of genuine hurt in his personal life stemming from the drawn-out end of his marriage to his wife Sara, which would be finalized with their formal divorce in 1977. In particular, "If You See Her" is absolutely heartbreaking, and sadly beautiful in a way very few of his other songs approach. That said, "Tangled Up in Blue" mixes up ostensible bits of his personal life with a more ambiguous menage a trois narrative, saying nothing of how many configurations you\'ll encounter in the form of alternate takes and live readings of the song. And we haven\'t yet even gotten around to mentioning the extraordinary "Idiot Wind", which is possibly the angriest song he\'s ever penned, an absolutely ferocious indictment of the press and, again only ostensibly, his soon-to-be ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is indeed far from a straight-ahead exercise in painful autobiography, it\'s become one of the great benchmarks of introspective melancholy in the rock canon, alongside Nick Drake\'s &lt;i&gt;Pink Moon&lt;/i&gt;, John Lennon\'s &lt;i&gt;Plastic Ono Band&lt;/i&gt; and Neil Young\'s closely contemporaneous &lt;i&gt;Tonight\'s the Night&lt;/i&gt;. Despite that, however, what really distinguishes &lt;i&gt;Blood on the Tracks&lt;/i&gt; as one of Dylan\'s masterworks is how warm and inviting this emotionally intense material winds up being, and how much at ease he sounds performing these songs, which by his standards are most likely a lot more revealing about his true personality than he\'d like to publicly admit. It\'s also tremendously ironic in hindsight that he\'s backed up by Nashville session pros. It wasn\'t the first time he had worked with these kind of guys, not at all, but he wound up producing one of the most "professional"-sounding recordings he\'d made up to that point, in startling contrast to the still-startling rawness of his lyrics and the way he sings them. A stunner that he\'d never top, and the kind of flat-out perfect piece of work most singer/songwriters simply don\'t have in them.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/bob-dylan-blood-on-tracks-1975.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGLo5hg8fY8/VZIhv47AD9I/AAAAAAAAAuw/AcmM8nD7Sos/s72-c/MI0001462461.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7306591723289755263</guid><pubdate>Sun, 28 Jun 2015 07:49:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-28T00:49:50.705-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Flying Burrito Brothers "The Gilded Palace of Sin" (1969)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZmAsHfoFA0/VY-cCALo1lI/AAAAAAAAAuU/A6i3z0m0KDg/s1600/MI0000014522.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZmAsHfoFA0/VY-cCALo1lI/AAAAAAAAAuU/A6i3z0m0KDg/s320/MI0000014522.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Though hardly anyone seemed to be paying attention to it at the end of the 60\'s, Gram Parsons had already very much got the ball rolling with what he called "Cosmic American Music" as a leading member of The International Submarine Band and a revamped Byrds. It didn\'t help his case that he\'d had all but one of his lead vocal parts on the latter\'s enormously influential &lt;i&gt;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&lt;/i&gt; overdubbed in the post-production stage, due to a contractual dispute with the label that had distributed The ISB\'s lone self-titled LP just months earlier, which by all accounts Parsons didn\'t seem to understand and led to much animosity towards his ex-bandmates. He wasn\'t yet recognized as a cutting-edge figure in both rock and country music, and unfortunately when he and Byrds bassist Chris Hillman paired off to form The Flying Burrito Brothers, there was no additional attention to be garnered. Upon its release in February 1969, &lt;i&gt;The Gilded Palace of Sin&lt;/i&gt; peaked at a woeful #164 on the Billboard charts, even as "country-rock" was already slowly beginning to take hold, but like The Velvet Underground or The Ramones, the Burritos\' rather dismal record sales didn\'t derail their massive influence over immediately succeeding generations of musicians. Within ten years, that "country-rock" had morphed into slick soft rock and taken the charts by the throat, Parsons was dead, and not one of the far more successful, later country-rock bands (i.e. The Eagles) had done the bastard child of a subgenre as much justice as the blighted Burritos did on their commercial flop of a debut album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moreso than &lt;i&gt;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Gilded Palace of Sin &lt;/i&gt;truly is old-fashioned C&amp;amp;W brought up to date in the Age of Aquarius, satirizing the counterculture while embracing it in a most underemphasized and refreshing way. Parsons sings "Sin City, a loving tribute to (and send-up of) The Louvin Brothers\' sinners-and-saints country ballads, with both a knowing humor and a reverent veneration for the form, which is obviously hard to do, but of course he doesn\'t seem to have to try too hard to make it sound right. It just came naturally out of him, that vision of "Cosmic American Music" mixing folk, soul, gospel, country, rock, whatever, that he held so dear and which he realized as fully as he could during what would turn out to be a tragically brief career. It\'s that effortlessness and the undeniable sartorial ties to anti-establishment rock &amp;amp; roll which make &lt;i&gt;The Gilded Palace of Sin&lt;/i&gt; so remarkably different from what Music City was producing then, which is undoubtedly a big part of the reason it along with &lt;i&gt;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&lt;/i&gt; and even Dylan\'s &lt;i&gt;Nashville Skyline&lt;/i&gt; were received with considerable indifference from both the rock press and the country music establishment at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gram once called George Jones "The King of The Broken Hearts", and most any true-blue old-school country music fan worth their salt would agree with him, but he rivals The Possum and any number of his other heroes with the gorgeously wounded "Hot Burrito #1", which is then promptly followed by the rollicking, uptempo R&amp;amp;B of "#2", showing that Parsons and the Burritos were far more than just the sum of country or rock music. It\'s not the only time that the group\'s soulfulness is on full display; just check out their take on "Do Right Woman, Do Right Man" or "Dark End of the Street", two standards both written by soul and R&amp;amp;B songwriters Chips Moman and Dan Penn. At just 22, you can\'t help but think Gram had already perfected his unique vision, but it\'s astonishing to think he was pretty much just getting started. As it would turn out, he never quite topped his mastery of a new kind of honky-tonk as heard on &lt;i&gt;The Gilded Palace of Sin&lt;/i&gt;. As such, it stands as his masterpiece, as well as one of the best and most unexpectedly influential records of its time, regardless of genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-flying-burrito-brothers-gilded.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xZmAsHfoFA0/VY-cCALo1lI/AAAAAAAAAuU/A6i3z0m0KDg/s72-c/MI0000014522.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2077951055516845614</guid><pubdate>Wed, 24 Jun 2015 00:35:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-23T17:35:02.122-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "Another Side of Bob Dylan" (1964)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bHZ1JvjXzWQ/VYnoRgCPhpI/AAAAAAAAAsA/jnz52REW9QU/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_Another_Side_of_Bob_Dylan.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bHZ1JvjXzWQ/VYnoRgCPhpI/AAAAAAAAAsA/jnz52REW9QU/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_Another_Side_of_Bob_Dylan.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Recorded in just one night in the summer of 1964, Dylan truly began the process of an unprecedented shift not only in his own songwriting, but in the shape of popular music lyrics in general with his fourth album. If 1963\'s &lt;i&gt;The Freewheelin\' Bob Dylan &lt;/i&gt;was a substantial step up from the staunchly traditional folkie material of the eponymous debut album, &lt;i&gt;Another Side &lt;/i&gt;is Dylan liberated from the confines of the topical protest song form that dominated the preceding &lt;i&gt;Times They Are A-Changing&lt;/i&gt;. As he famously put it at the time, there are no "finger-pointin\' songs" here, though a similar social conscience managed to slip out in "Chimes of Freedom" and its references to the killing of John F. Kennedy the previous fall. Otherwise, in their place are songs heavily inspired by the demise of his relationship with Suze Rotolo, along with early manifestations of the dense, playfully inscrutable narratives that Dylan would only continue to perfect, right from the opening "All I Really Want to Do", which would be covered to much commercial success by both Sonny &amp;amp; Cher and The Byrds the following year as "folk-rock" took off on both the American and British pop charts. It\'s one of his funniest and sweetest love songs, as he rattles off an absolutely mind-boggling, random series of things he promises not to do to the subject of his affection. Ultimately, he just wants to be friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In another song, Bob kisses off both his own earlier self-seriousness and the sanctimoniousness of the folkie milieu he had come out of in "My Back Pages", yet another song that found greater success in the hands of The Byrds a few years later, and which would be a telling refutation of the strictures of traditional folk music that would come fully to the fore with the ensuing &lt;i&gt;Bringing It All Back Home&lt;/i&gt; and his infamous performance at 1965\'s Newport Folk Festival. There, he would smash down those strictures with searing electric rock &amp;amp; roll and a sneering "fuck you" attitude to back it up, but his words on this acoustic ballad are just as dynamite: "Ah, but I was so much older then/I\'m younger than that now". To be honest, some of its surreal imagery ("corpse evangelists", "confusion boats", "half-wracked prejudice leaped forth") doesn\'t stand up so well in comparison to the concurrently composed "Mr. Tambourine Man" or "Visions of Johanna", or any number of his other much-analyzed mid-60\'s songs, but that chorus is at once moving, memorable and absolutely brilliant. "Motorpsycho Nitemare" is even funnier, where Dylan scams on a girl named Rita and has to avoid getting killed or "turned into the FBI" by her dad when he proclaims that he likes "Fidel Castro and his beard".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that as great and, in fact, essential as it ultimately is, &lt;i&gt;Another Side &lt;/i&gt;is very much a transitional album, with its feet firmly out the door from the traditional folk community and ethos but not yet completely on top of the enigmatic, self-effacing persona he cultivated over the next several albums, culminating in the drug-influenced, hard-rocking and wildly surreal masterpiece &lt;i&gt;Blonde on Blonde &lt;/i&gt;in 1966. Here, he made the particular misstep of the lengthy "Ballad in Plain D", a painfully (and uncharacteristically) autobiographical account of the obviously traumatic dissolution of his relationship with Suze Rotolo, which had ended with a violent confrontation between the two several months before the album\'s recording. It mixes regretful, rather melodramatic prose with a particularly vindictive view of Rotolo\'s older sister Carla, which by all accounts wasn\'t necessary and spoke of a guy who was still very upset and angry over what had happened when he wrote the song. As anyone from heartbroken teenagers to other iconic artists can tell you, art (in general, but poetry or songwriting in particular) created in this mindset is &lt;i&gt;very &lt;/i&gt;much hit or miss and can result in some ultimately cringe-worthy stuff. "Plain D" is hardly cringe-worthy, but just a bit immature and tedious both in its length and its lyrics, unlike the immediately preceding "I Don\'t Believe You" or the immediately ensuing closer "It Ain\'t Me Babe", which deal with the same subject matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dylan wouldn\'t make another record with this kind of in-the-room intimacy till &lt;i&gt;Blood on the Tracks &lt;/i&gt;ten years later, which is why it\'s such a distinctive and consistently engaging piece of work despite whatever lyrical shortcomings are hiding here or there, and moreso than any other album it\'s laden with material that would be turned into pop chart success for numerous other artists. And all this from one recording session and by just Dylan himself, mostly just singing, blowing harp and playing guitar.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/bob-dylan-another-side-of-bob-dylan-1964.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bHZ1JvjXzWQ/VYnoRgCPhpI/AAAAAAAAAsA/jnz52REW9QU/s72-c/Bob_Dylan_-_Another_Side_of_Bob_Dylan.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5707192608216114899</guid><pubdate>Tue, 23 Jun 2015 22:21:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-23T18:03:48.889-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bob Dylan "John Wesley Harding" (1967)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiFckQOmYtk/VYnRCPesdTI/AAAAAAAAArs/nkgZyyo7beo/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_John_Wesley_Harding.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiFckQOmYtk/VYnRCPesdTI/AAAAAAAAArs/nkgZyyo7beo/s1600/Bob_Dylan_-_John_Wesley_Harding.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After reaching the peak of his "wild, thin mercury sound" with the careening, brilliant double-LP &lt;i&gt;Blonde on Blonde&lt;/i&gt;, Dylan was involved in a mysterious motorcycle accident outside his home in Woodstock, NY in the summer of 1966. The details and severity of this accident are still being debated to this very day, but in any measure Dylan went into near-total seclusion from the music industry for close to a year and a half afterwards, even as artists continued to cover and find success with his songs. Over that period of time, rock &amp;amp; roll music went psychedelic with the emergence of San Francisco hippie ballroom-dwellers like the Jefferson Airplane and Grateful Dead, The Beatles\' &lt;i&gt;Sgt. Pepper\'s &lt;/i&gt;and "Strawberry Fields Forever", and the mind-bending guitar pyrotechnics of (well-known Dylan fan) Jimi Hendrix. Dylan and his longtime backing group The Hawks, soon to begin recording on their own as The Band, cooked up a now-legendary series of recordings at a rented house known as Big Pink in Saugerties, New York that would become known as "The Basement Tapes" and take on a life of their own over the years, but were left officially unreleased at the time of their being committed to tape. With hindsight, they now reveal Dylan taking a looser and more laid-back approach to his songs in terms of both the words and the music itself, as opposed to the wiry, stream-of-consciousness rock &amp;amp; roll of &lt;i&gt;Highway 61 Revisited &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Blonde on Blonde.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following through on this musical path, Dylan quietly released &lt;i&gt;John Wesley Harding &lt;/i&gt;in the closing days of 1967, and as he had shocked the audience of the Newport Folk Festival two years earlier with his electric rock accompaniment, listeners were completely taken aback by its warm, gentle country-folk sound and how much more quiet it was compared to its three predecessors. What\'s also notable about the album is how much warmer and more compassionate Dylan\'s lyrics often are, pleading for love and understanding from an unspecified master hand in "Dear Landlord", turning the namesake Old West gunslinger into a real-life Robin Hood (in his own words, "a friend to the poor" who would "never hurt an honest man") on the title track, and all the while keeping his gift for inscrutability intact as ever in "Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest", "The Wicked Messenger" and the understated, open-ended original version of "All Along the Watchtower". Hendrix\'s positively apocalyptic (and much more famous) take on "Watchtower" may be quite frankly the greatest reinterpretation of any song in rock history, as agreed upon even by Dylan himself, but his original rendition has a captivating, ominous air all its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s not quite the equal of his previous two albums, but it would be a tremendously important landmark in the development of country-rock, which would take full shape over the course of the following two years with subsequent groundbreaking records like The Byrds\' &lt;i&gt;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&lt;/i&gt; and The Flying Burrito Brothers\' &lt;i&gt;Guilded Palace of Sin&lt;/i&gt;. It winds up being one of Dylan\'s most consistent and approachable records, and one of his best just because of how well he was able to take his songs in an entirely new direction, while keeping all of his inimitable songwriting and narrative flair.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/bob-dylan-john-wesley-harding-1967.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FiFckQOmYtk/VYnRCPesdTI/AAAAAAAAArs/nkgZyyo7beo/s72-c/Bob_Dylan_-_John_Wesley_Harding.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2395452025613491909</guid><pubdate>Fri, 19 Jun 2015 03:50:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-18T20:50:25.382-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Nick Drake "Pink Moon" (1972)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SpolXPbgl7c/VYN4sYbdpII/AAAAAAAAArU/c8I_IwcuNPo/s1600/NickDrakePinkMoon.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SpolXPbgl7c/VYN4sYbdpII/AAAAAAAAArU/c8I_IwcuNPo/s1600/NickDrakePinkMoon.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By the age of 23, Nick Drake had recorded two albums that were indisputably excellent and sounded like the work of no other singer/songwriter of the late 60\'s or early 70\'s, but both of them had passed almost totally unnoticed by critics and the music-buying masses alike, not helped by Drake\'s near-total refusal to perform live, appear on television or give interviews. He also felt dissatisfied with certain aspects of the production of those first two outings, the debut &lt;i&gt;Five Leaves Left &lt;/i&gt;and its even more impressive follow-up &lt;i&gt;Bryter Layter&lt;/i&gt;, though both were hardly as egregiously overproduced as some of the material being put out by singer/songwriters who were getting bigger commercially at that moment than Drake could possibly have conceived of at any time in what would end up being just 26 years of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wanted to strip everything down to just him and his guitar, singing and playing with none of the modest, but very central accompaniment he\'d had from folks like Richard Thompson on his previous two records, a decision he\'d apparently made as soon as recording for &lt;i&gt;Bryter &lt;/i&gt;was finished up. Everything on &lt;i&gt;Pink Moon&lt;/i&gt;, all 28 and a half minutes of it, was recorded in two brief late-night sessions in October 1971, and the one and only exception to Drake\'s strictly voice-and-guitar concept is a lovely bit of piano on the title track, which decades later somewhat bizarrely appeared in a Volkswagen commercial. Legend had it for many years that he delivered the sixteen-track master recordings, which contained a brief instrumental cut of the ancient "Plaisir d\'amour" that he wanted left off the final album, anonymously in a plastic bag to the reception area of his label Island Records, without anyone immediately noticing it. This was proven untrue by eyewitness testimony to an obscure Drake-centric fanzine, namely that of Island press officer Dave Sandison, who rectified the rumor by saying he\'d delivered it (labeled "NICK DRAKE PINK MOON") directly to Chris Blackwell, albeit without telling anyone it was his new album or saying much of anything about it. The classic surrealist album art wasn\'t even his idea, rather a painting by an artist named Michael Trevithick (who actually happened to be a friend of Drake\'s sister) selected by the record company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rumor mill about its production speaks to how well solidified Drake\'s myth is, as a perpetually somber, brooding loner who seems much like he was always a ghost to the cult of fans that has grown steadily since the mid-80\'s. When you really get down to brass tacks, although Nick suffered from serious mental illness and severe clinical depression throughout his brief recording career, his small but priceless oeuvre speaks less to an eternally depressive mindset so much as it speaks to the mind and muse of someone who always existed outside of the music industry and apart from his contemporaries, not giving anywhere near as much of himself or his true personality to the audience as even most of the commercial-juggernaut "sensitive singer/songwriters" did then. The despair and the deep sense of isolation and alienation are all very much there, and indeed are central components of his work, but at least I\'ve never seen it as entirely bleak as much as it is one of the most elliptical and mysterious bodies of work in all of popular music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pink Moon&lt;/i&gt; is laden with the imagery of disease, disconnection and despair, but it has a quality very much like the recordings of the similarly mysterious, unknowable Robert Johnson of three-plus decades earlier; the darkness is just part of the music\'s character, rather than a cloud of anguish hovering over every note. The surprisingly bluesy "Know" is perhaps as simple and brutally direct as most any songwriter has ever been, consisting entirely of one repeated haiku of a verse: "Know that I love you/Know I don\'t care/Know that I see you/Know I\'m not there". "Parasite" is the full realization of his melancholy vision, wherein he paints a vividly evocative picture of himself as being nothing more than a parasite clinging to your skirt, or in the dirt, or in town, much like Iggy Pop\'s "Passenger" who stays under glass looking out at the world from Jim Morrison\'s modern-life-as-car-trip. Rarely had anyone spoken of pure disenfranchisement with such astonishing beauty in song, or like in any of the other songs on &lt;i&gt;Pink Moon&lt;/i&gt;. Indeed, it is very much an unintentional concept album about a state of complete and total isolation, both mentally and physically, brought out by the literal isolation of him being the only musician on the album, and being locked off from the rest of the world by his debilitating depression and terminally quiet, noncommunicative nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enigmatic, spare and painfully brief, &lt;i&gt;Pink Moon &lt;/i&gt;is nothing short of a masterwork, which has only grown in stature in the decades since its release to very little critical (and basically no commercial) notice in early 1972.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/nick-drake-pink-moon-1972.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SpolXPbgl7c/VYN4sYbdpII/AAAAAAAAArU/c8I_IwcuNPo/s72-c/NickDrakePinkMoon.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3651595834484843225</guid><pubdate>Mon, 15 Jun 2015 08:59:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-15T02:05:44.010-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Germs "(GI)" (1979)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CvmScjm7n2o/VX5TnhVw1kI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/g8w9s2KUe4g/s1600/330px-Germs_-_%2528GI%2529_cover.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="317" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CvmScjm7n2o/VX5TnhVw1kI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/g8w9s2KUe4g/s320/330px-Germs_-_%2528GI%2529_cover.png" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It wasn\'t supposed to be this way. The Germs began as a complete and total joke band, four teenagers getting onstage for an open-mic night and playing a few tedious minutes of incoherent noise and getting thrown offstage for fucking with a more "serious" band\'s gear (to be exact, smearing peanut butter on a bass amp that belonged to fellow Los Angeles punkers the Zeros). When first released, their home-recorded debut single ("Forming", backed with the live recording "Sex Boy") was seen as an amusingly bad novelty piece, and the band were widely dismissed by members of the nascent L.A. punk rock scene. None of the detractors would ever surmise that aside from X, The Germs would move to the forefront of L.A. punk and hardcore in terms of the way its history is recounted a third of a century later, or for that matter that guitarist Pat Smear would eventually end up in not one, but two of the most successful rock bands of the 1990\'s all thanks to his notoriety as a Germ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although they were much more popular and locally acclaimed by the time they released a full-length LP in 1979, it was still a shock for many fans and critics alike to read and hear clearly the surprisingly wordy, intelligent lyrics of the maniac vocalist Darby Crash, who was well known for his intoxicated behavior onstage and particularly for either "singing" completely incoherently or not even singing into the microphone during performances. The fucked-up noise of their earliest days had become a still-noisy but far more determinedly furious sound, with Don Bolles\' manic drums and Lorna Doom\'s solid low-end work complementing Smear\'s blistering guitar and Crash\'s feral abandon. For her part, none other than Joan Jett, at the tail end of her Runaway days, sat behind the boards and (along with engineer Pat Burnette, of course) gave the album a crisp, roomy, and above all else savage sound, which they probably couldn\'t have attained if they\'d somehow managed to get first choice Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere &amp;amp; the Raiders to make the record with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;(GI)&lt;/i&gt;, titled after a moniker The Germs had begun to use to get booked in clubs which had banned them in L.A., starts off with one of the fastest and shortest punk songs that had yet come out of the US at the end of the 70\'s, the paranoid 43-second "What We Do is Secret" (later the title of a fine biopic about Crash\'s life and times), which aligned them as a favorite with the burgeoning suburban hardcore uprising that was beginning to splinter off from the original, artier Hollywood/L.A. scene. It\'s fitting that they bookend their shortest song, of both the album and their entire oeuvre, with their longest, closing out the album with the nine-minute, apocalyptic "Shut Down (Annihilation Man)", which proves that even as tight a band as they\'d become they still had a soft spot for pure, uninhibited mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In-between, both band and singer/lyricist are in top form. Darby Crash is positively spinning out of control on a syllabus cribbed from the ideas of Hitler, Bowie, Manson and Nietzsche, all coalescing into a searing account of alienation and reckless self-destruction. The group recut perhaps their greatest song, "Lexicon Devil", which had been released a year earlier as the title track of a sensational EP; with a more guttural performance from Crash and a faster, busier beat from Bolles (as opposed to the previous EP\'s Nickey "Beat" Alexander), its anthemic signature-song quality is offset by sheer urgency and mad desperation, like it\'s the last song the foursome will ever play and Crash is already about to head into his inevitable demise. "Manimal" starts off burning slow, simmering ominously before exploding into one of their most furious and intense songs, a startling view of the line between man and animal made all the more convincing by Darby\'s primordial growl. In "We Must Bleed", it sounds like the group could fall apart at any moment, rushing towards its shambolic non-climax with Darby screaming "I want out now" and the riff spiraling round &amp;amp; round like a spinning carnival ride about to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Darby wouldn\'t meet his actual demise till over a year after the album\'s release, on 7 December 1980 of a heroin overdose, and they made some recordings afterward for an almost entirely abandoned soundtrack for the William Friedkin film "Cruising", but encapsulated in The Germs\' one and only album is the entirety of everything that defined the short, fast life of a boy who was born Jan Paul Beahm and morphed into a frighteningly charismatic creature before he was even 20 years old. He died at age 22 as a full-blown legend among a small, but very important group of people that would, many years later, come to much greater mass attention than Darby Crash or his disciples could\'ve conceived of. In other words, &lt;i&gt;(GI) &lt;/i&gt;is one of those fantastic records that took many years to be fully recognized as the seminal classic that it is, and which had an enormous impact that no one would ever have predicted when Crash was alive. It still gives you an unmistakable feeling that all hell is breaking loose upon the earth, every time you hear it, and you can only capture that kind of lightning in a bottle once. That is, if you ever get to capture it at all.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-germs-gi-1979.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CvmScjm7n2o/VX5TnhVw1kI/AAAAAAAAAqQ/g8w9s2KUe4g/s72-c/330px-Germs_-_%2528GI%2529_cover.png" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3377641655525240849</guid><pubdate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 21:57:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-11T14:57:49.135-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Smiths "The Queen is Dead" (1986)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_5Z8g9PStoQ/VXn1zJdM3_I/AAAAAAAAApw/yHexU2-raLs/s1600/MI0001612246.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="312" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_5Z8g9PStoQ/VXn1zJdM3_I/AAAAAAAAApw/yHexU2-raLs/s320/MI0001612246.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Smiths were one of those great rock bands that accomplished a whole lot in a surprisingly small window of time, in their case four albums and a slew of singles that pretty much never ranked below "very good" in terms of sheer quality, all in a five-year period. Because of how fast and quick they developed into one of the very best bands of their time, if not all time, their third album isn\'t just the moment where all the parts finally fit perfectly and everything clicked into a great, cohesive whole; it\'s the kind of fully-fledged masterwork that most bands could never even conceive of. As great as their eponymous debut, the &lt;i&gt;Hatful of Hollow &lt;/i&gt;compilation and parts of the otherwise flawed &lt;i&gt;Meat is Murder&lt;/i&gt; all were, &lt;i&gt;The Queen is Dead&lt;/i&gt; is simply perfect, which is a very rare attribute even among rock\'s most revered records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts with one of the best album-openers in rock &amp;amp; roll history, the epic, surging title track prefaced by a memorably random, almost Fellini-esque snippet of audio from one of Morrissey\'s beloved early-60\'s "kitchen sink" dramas. It\'s one of Morrissey\'s greatest songs and performances, filled with positively genius turns of phrase ("She said "I know you and you cannot sing"/I said "that\'s nothing, you should hear my play piano!"), and sees him jumping across what seems to be a schizophrenic valley of wildly diffuse subject matter to arrive at an apocalyptic condemnation of the state of England at the height of the Thatcher era. It announces right off the bat that this album is the hardest-rocking thing the band has ever done, or ever will do, and what\'s more they rock like no one else but them, with Johnny Marr\'s unique web of guitars and a rhythm section (drummer Mike Joyce and bassist Andy Rourke) that was always to-die-for. Just from the work of Marr, Joyce and Rourke alone, this is the band at its most effortlessly versatile and inventive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right away, the title track encapsulates what really makes &lt;i&gt;The Queen is Dead&lt;/i&gt; the band\'s greatest work; it\'s their most direct and accessible album in every way, not saddled with the polarization that comes with a contentiously murky production or supposedly pedophilic lyrics (&lt;i&gt;The Smiths&lt;/i&gt;), or overwrought, equally contentious social issues (&lt;i&gt;Meat is Murder&lt;/i&gt;). Many people, fan and non-fan alike, have griped about the heavy-handed moralizing of "Meat is Murder" (the song) or "Barbarism Begins at Home", or winced at the miserablism of "Heaven Knows I\'m Miserable Now", or found "This Charming Man" much too overly precious. Far fewer among any of them could fault the brutally honest, uncharacteristically direct despair of "I Know It\'s Over"; the way "Cemetry Gates" ingeniously juxtaposes one of their bounciest and brightest tunes to a lyric deriding literary plagiarism; or how the extraordinary "There Is a Light That Never Goes Out" turns a typically melodramatic Morrissey scenario, of two outcasts in love who wish for a double-decker bus to hit them and take them away together from their unhappy home lives, into a soaring, majestic anthem that can resonate powerfully with anyone who hears it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There truly is not a bum note to be found here, even if songs like "The Boy With a Thorn in His Side", "Bigmouth Strikes Again" and "There Is a Light" are the obvious highlights as opposed to "Never Had No One Ever" or "Vicar in a Tutu", and even then the highlights take up most of this brilliantly concise and relatively short LP. Many great bands have one album in particular that stands as their finest hour, but few have ever made a towering masterpiece on the level of &lt;i&gt;The Queen is Dead&lt;/i&gt;, which is at the very least indisputably one of the most influential and important albums of the last 30 years, and to most who\'ve heard it it\'s one of the greatest albums of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/the-smiths-queen-is-dead-1986.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_5Z8g9PStoQ/VXn1zJdM3_I/AAAAAAAAApw/yHexU2-raLs/s72-c/MI0001612246.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-61877337758376303</guid><pubdate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 04:36:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-10T21:36:13.196-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Lydia Lunch "Queen of Siam" (1980)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Slrdo9QeTSk/VXkJWetxyqI/AAAAAAAAApY/JfQmuwzvYr4/s1600/Lydia_Lunch_-_Queen_of_Siam.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Slrdo9QeTSk/VXkJWetxyqI/AAAAAAAAApY/JfQmuwzvYr4/s1600/Lydia_Lunch_-_Queen_of_Siam.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;At the end of the 70\'s, few rock singers were as completely unique and ceaselessly confrontational as Lydia Lunch, when she yowled, screamed and chanted over the painfully harsh racket of Teenage Jesus &amp;amp; the Jerks, who were one of the definitive groups of New York\'s short-lived (but very influential) "no wave" movement. Quite unsurprisingly, they themselves didn\'t last long, and soon Lunch (just 20 years old by now) went into a small, obscure studio in New York to record a solo album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1980\'s &lt;i&gt;Queen of Siam&lt;/i&gt;, released on ZE Records, showed that Lunch was far from just an intriguing performance artist, and that she did indeed possess a formidably seductive persona that made her out to be a kind of demonic chanteuse rather than a brattier-than-the-norm teenager. The avant-garde elements of her earlier work aren\'t at all gone, but the overtly abrasive noise has been quite heavily tapered down in favor of a dynamic lounge jazz backdrop for her voice, which is often quite like a younger, more rambunctious Patti Smith (in a very good way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her songs are at once thoroughly undefinable and vividly New York City in their sound and attitude, but the best moment comes in the form of a very, very sexy version of the Classics IV\'s "Spooky"; trailing close behind it is the pure film noir of "Lady Scarface", a positively doom-laden, near-whispered "Gloomy Sunday", and the demented little-girl meow of "Mechanical Flattery" and "Tied &amp;amp; Twist". &lt;i&gt;Queen &lt;/i&gt;is an often overlooked, modest little gem from the heady era in which it was made, and even if it isn\'t exactly a perfect album, it sure is one of those underappreciated records that a lot more people ought to hear.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/lydia-lunch-queen-of-siam-1980.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Slrdo9QeTSk/VXkJWetxyqI/AAAAAAAAApY/JfQmuwzvYr4/s72-c/Lydia_Lunch_-_Queen_of_Siam.jpeg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1241386711985521993</guid><pubdate>Thu, 04 Jun 2015 22:57:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-06-05T22:57:29.143-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Johnny Thunders "So Alone" (1978)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FRWB5k34fNA/VXDI_W7rnFI/AAAAAAAAAn8/-jzuszT7Euo/s1600/MI0002164934.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FRWB5k34fNA/VXDI_W7rnFI/AAAAAAAAAn8/-jzuszT7Euo/s1600/MI0002164934.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Having already left an indelible imprint on rock &amp;amp; roll with the legendary New York Dolls, and then been the leader of CBGB favorites the Heartbreakers (not to be confused with Tom Petty\'s band that happened to emerge at the exact same time), Johnny Thunders was already a living legend at just 26 years old when he went into the studio in 1978 to record his first full-fledged solo album, &lt;i&gt;So Alone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Befitting a man of such high stature in the early history of the booming punk/new wave frontier, he had quite an impressive guest list for the sessions: a pre-fame Chrissie Hynde contributing backing vocals to a version of the Dolls classic "Subway Train"; Peter Perrett, the notoriously troubled frontman of new wave heroes The Only Ones, contributing backing vocals and guitar to several songs; ex-Sex Pistols Steve Jones and Paul Cook playing guitar and drums on several songs, including quite ironically the song "London Boys", a pointed response to the Pistols\' sneering "New York"; Small Faces/Humble Pie leader and bona-fide rock legend Steve Marriott &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;Thin Lizzy\'s Phil Lynott, both making notable cameos on Otis Blackwell\'s "Daddy Rollin\' Stone".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make no mistake, however; this is Johnny\'s show, from the gloriously out-of-tune vocal and guitar performance on "Great Big Kiss" to the remake of the one Dolls song he had sung lead on, "Chatterbox" (slightly rewritten and retitled "Leave Me Alone"). It\'s a thoroughly entertaining, endearingly messy collection of songs, even though it clearly illustrates that Johnny was not one of rock\'s great creative rivers when it came to songwriting, what with how only four of its ten songs were written solely by Johnny himself. One of those four songs, however, stands out from the rest of the album and from anything Johnny recorded over the ensuing 13 years until his (sadly, very predictable) death from a heroin overdose in 1991. "You Can\'t Put Your Arms Round a Memory" is not only Johnny\'s single greatest song, but it\'s also one of the saddest and most heartbreaking (no pun intended) songs in the entire rock &amp;amp; roll canon. Friends of Johnny\'s have since claimed that the song was actually written years before its recording here, and before he had ever tried heroin, but now you can\'t help but hear one of the most painfully autobiographical statements any rock &amp;amp; roller had ever made up to that point, or ever would again. Heard today, it\'s nothing short of a bittersweet elegy to one of rock\'s most notorious dope casualties, penned by the man himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s also undoubtedly sadder still in light of how easily and quickly Johnny\'s solo career deteriorated in the 1980\'s, when it got to the point where he would sometimes stumble off the stage during gigs, and turned out just a few more unremarkable solo albums interspersed with even more spotty live recordings, both legal and otherwise. But the first time out on his own, he created hands-down the best piece of work to emerge from a former New York Doll after their original breakup, and for one album all the qualities that made Thunders a star and an icon would be on full display.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/06/johnny-thunders-so-alone-1978.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FRWB5k34fNA/VXDI_W7rnFI/AAAAAAAAAn8/-jzuszT7Euo/s72-c/MI0002164934.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3785384564464263118</guid><pubdate>Fri, 29 May 2015 07:10:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-29T00:35:11.164-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Life Stories</category><title>We\'re Gonna Die (Send Those Curse Words to Hell!)</title><description>For two months, the kids in my little social group that hung with me at the United Action for Youth Center were all eagerly anticipating the event in which we were gonna "GET SCHOOLED!" at Public Space One in Iowa City. For one month, a couple of those kids were getting geared up to play their very first show as a band, consisting of just a guitar player and a drummer, both girls. My main buddies, for their part, were playing their third show as a band, along with a new band from out of town called Painted Disaster, a heavy indie/blues-rock band called The Projectors, the headlining HOTT, and a horrible Christian emo band whose name need not be mentioned for fear of this article possibly garnering listener attention to them, because unfortunately, they\'re still active. The day afterward was my man Detrell\'s 16th birthday, and we were also looking forward to his birthday party at the house of his girlfriend at the time, who was a member of the band playing their first show at PS1. For a one-two punch Friday and Saturday up ahead, it was indeed shaping up to be an awesome weekend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With signs posted everywhere saying "NO ALCOHOL ALLOWED", a very sparse stage in a small room, and a whole bomb-ass passel of anticipation, an unusually large crowd (in PS1 terms) watched the newest band take the stage, the duo who knocked out songs like their cover of "Bitchin\' Camaro" by the Dead Milkmen and an original where they just kept shouting "We\'re gonna die! We\'re gonna die!" over a standard punk rock one-two one-two. My buddy\'s band, who had been in a failed band with me a year previously and then split off to form the trio that now called themselves Other Band, were up next. If memory serves, The Projectors took the stage after them, followed by Painted Disaster and the godawful Christian band, topped off by a scorching performance from HOTT. Two-fourths of HOTT were in their mid-forties, members of the original 1980\'s punk rock scene in Iowa City, and that includes the lead singer, but that 46-year-old frontman led the band through an absolute barn-burner of a performance with boundless energy and enthusiasm, and it was a perfect capper to one of the most exciting nights I\'d ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this triumphant show, me and the members of Other Band, along with two other mutual friends, went to spend the night at Detrell\'s before we all went to UAY in the morning to hang out before most of us wound up at his girlfriend\'s house to rock out and eat pizza. But before we even got to the house, which was his grandpa\'s and tucked away in a rather secluded spot that was neighbored by only two other houses, I was immensely annoyed and irritated by something Detrell said to his visitors: "No swearing at my house!" He didn\'t want anyone saying "fuck" or "shit" in particular at his house because he "respected his grandfather too much", or something like that. I could understand if he wanted us to not be cussing it up in front of his grandpa, thus incurring the grandfather\'s costernation and scolding of Detrell, but that old dude was asleep by then. At least I thought. I was later told that he\'d caught wind of some of the cusswords that I let rip with anyway cause I absolutely despised (and still do despise, or would) being told not to say this or that in general, but &lt;i&gt;especially &lt;/i&gt;the idea of being told "watch your language" by my &lt;i&gt;friends&lt;/i&gt;. Not my mother or father or a teacher or somebody like that, but my &lt;i&gt;friends&lt;/i&gt;! It pissed me off even more when I crabbed to his Other Band co-conspirator Max on the bus down to UAY the next morning, and he responded without humor something like "oh, when someone says such and such, you can\'t do that". Man, did &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;piss me off. His whole odd little churchboy demeanor in that moment and the way he said "you can\'t do that" festered in my mind and would continue to grate on me even thinking about it long after the fact, probably because I\'m mentally unstable and am well-known to have a bizarrely vivid memory of totally ephemeral, ridiculous shit like that. The other noteworthy thing that night was, one of the dudes there had skipped school that day and his mother  tracked him down using his cellphone signal, and she grounded him on the  spot and took him home, all without much of a scene being made.  Detrell\'s grandpa asked the rest of us if we were "supposed to be there" or not, and of course the answer was yes, though with Detrell\'s behavior I was wondering whether or not it was a good idea to come over in the first place. In any case, the real reason for Detrell\'s "rule" was most likely that his grandpa would hear the "offending words" through the thin, crappy walls of their claustrophobic, tiny dwelling and get mad at his grandson, even if he wasn\'t the one speaking those curse words. For the record, it was still totally acceptable to watch a Blink-182 documentary that was full of unapologetic vulgarity, oddly enough. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But gone from that house and Detrell\'s weird "rule" we were now, and after a few hours at UAY I was headed out to his girlfriend\'s house to party with two-fourths of Other Band (Detrell and then-bassist Martin, rather than Max, who had crazy parents that wouldn\'t allow him to be there or something). Of course, let\'s not forget that guitar-slingin\' girlfriend of his, or her drumming cohort, or the other couple of friends that joined us in our drunken-and-high adolescent revelry. We got totally fucked up with an ounce of weed and a twelve-pack of-&lt;i&gt;oh wait, that didn\'t happen&lt;/i&gt;. Detrell was virulently anti-substances at the time, and anyway his girlfriend\'s family were all over the place and would\'ve whooped all our asses. We all took turns jamming out on our twangers and percussion instruments in the basement, which was simply fabulous and a whole lotta fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When our gang wandered to a nearby schoolyard park, we did encounter someone who appeared to be engaging in the aforementioned revelry, a high school girl who was stumbling across the park with a slightly less intoxicated friend. A few people in our group knew \'em, and mentioned that apparently one of the girls had a scary meth-addict father who beat her up. Someone jokingly suggested that I start chatting this random girl up, cause "she\'ll probably have sex with you", but not only was it an obvious joke, I also assumed that if she would she\'d probably take me back to the house with the scary dad and I might wind up getting wasted by a violent, methed-out psycho that I pictured in my head. (And no, unlike many of the "football heathens" I described in a previous piece, I would never take advantage of a drunk girl, or anyone else for that matter. Just to clarify, I ain\'t that kind of asshole.) As we all wound our way back, the birthday boy and his girlfriend were being lovey dovey, and I jibed them with a loud, manic rendition of Chuck Berry\'s "Rock &amp;amp; Roll Music" designed to annoy the shit out of them. It didn\'t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About eight or nine PM that night, the party was over, and I was on the way back home being given a ride by the girlfriend\'s stepdad, who may or may not have attempted to convert me into some sort of Unitarian Church thing. It didn\'t work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/were-gonna-die.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4392630574487372783</guid><pubdate>Thu, 28 May 2015 19:25:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-28T12:25:11.021-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Patti Smith "Horses" (1975)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SZkk2LgZl5c/VWdc86UIfMI/AAAAAAAAAnc/F9FibkeUJ6g/s1600/PattiSmithHorses.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SZkk2LgZl5c/VWdc86UIfMI/AAAAAAAAAnc/F9FibkeUJ6g/s1600/PattiSmithHorses.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It\'s a testament to the immense diversity of New York City\'s early punk/new wave scene in the mid-70\'s that the first two full-length albums to be released by members of this new uprising were, in order, The Dictators\' &lt;i&gt;Go Girl Crazy! &lt;/i&gt;and then Patti Smith\'s &lt;i&gt;Horses&lt;/i&gt;, both in 1975. Where the former was a gloriously lowbrow celebration of junk culture filtered through supercharged, trashy rock &amp;amp; roll, &lt;i&gt;Horses&lt;/i&gt; was (and is) practically uncategorizable. Its mixture of rock &amp;amp; roll, jazz, reggae and poetry was unlike anything that had come before it, and would seldom, if ever, be equaled even by Smith herself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the cover is a stone-cold classic photograph, of a rail-thin Smith posed androgynous in men\'s clothing and displaying absolutely no overt sexuality whatsoever. To begin with, fully fledged female rockers were very scarce back in 1975, but it was an entirely different kind of \'fuck you\', to an increasingly bloated and male-orientated rock biz, to pose like &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; on an album cover. It\'s an immediate tip-off that Smith was doing it her way, with no compromise and no limitations. It\'s as unique a piece of artwork in its own right as the music contained within, and needless to say it\'s one of the all-time great album covers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with one of the great cover photos in rock history, &lt;i&gt;Horses &lt;/i&gt;also happens to begin with one of the greatest album openers ever, which is her startling revamp of Van Morrison\'s "Gloria". Before the song proper even begins, in the first few seconds of the half-sung, half-spoken "In Excelsis Deo", she delivers the line that would define the rest of her career: "Jesus died for somebody\'s sins, but not mine". Rarely has any artist ever made as powerful a statement in just one simple line like Patti Smith did here, and along with the cover it\'s the first thing that took so many people aback when first listening to the album back then, before punk proper really existed as a defined form of rock &amp;amp; roll on either side of the Atlantic. Even more extraordinary is when the impressionistic intro piece gradually and seamlessly builds into her positively apocalyptic take on the old Them song, where she doesn\'t do a gender reversal for the object of affection in Morrison\'s original and her band plays it with more dramatic fury than in any other of the innumerable versions of the tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An opening that strong threatens to dwarf everything that follows, but the group effortlessly switches gears yet again for the lolloping reggae of "Redondo Beach", and then the lengthy improvisational piece "Birdland", followed by the furious "Free Money". All this on just the first half of the album, or side one in vinyl terms. "Gloria" may be one of the most radical and successful reworkings of a song that\'s ever been committed to tape, but "Land" is even more striking, where she talks about a boy named Johnny being accosted in school by a mysterious other boy in a leather jacket in a most sexual and dramatic manner, and then manages to weave this thoroughly ambiguous and abstract story in and out through Chris Kenner\'s early 60\'s hit "Land of a Thousand Dances". That\'s something that only a writer as idiosyncratic and individual as Smith could pull off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patti would only remain active in music for four more years and three more albums with the Patti Smith Group before breaking with the band and retiring for nearly a decade to be a full-time mom with husband Fred "Sonic" Smith of the MC5 and their son Jackson. In all her career since that time, she\'s never duplicated the sheer mastery of poetry, performance art and full-abandon rock &amp;amp; roll that she achieved with her debut album, which is why &lt;i&gt;Horses &lt;/i&gt;is one of rock\'s all-time great debuts and one of the greatest rock albums of all time, period.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/patti-smith-horses-1975.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-SZkk2LgZl5c/VWdc86UIfMI/AAAAAAAAAnc/F9FibkeUJ6g/s72-c/PattiSmithHorses.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6552695192579270682</guid><pubdate>Wed, 27 May 2015 21:51:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-27T14:51:19.317-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Dinosaur Jr. "You\'re Living All Over Me" (1987)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BemLilqGt2Y/VWY8Rzd_dAI/AAAAAAAAAm8/yhcLxoJ9kMI/s1600/602275_10201520878926971_2044493015_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BemLilqGt2Y/VWY8Rzd_dAI/AAAAAAAAAm8/yhcLxoJ9kMI/s1600/602275_10201520878926971_2044493015_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Rising from the ashes of the savage hardcore band Deep Wound,  Dinosaur didn\'t make the best impression with their self-titled 1985  debut album, often unsure as to what the group\'s sound really was. As  its 1987 follow-up &lt;em&gt;You\'re Living All Over Me &lt;/em&gt;proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, this developmental phase wouldn\'t last for long. For one thing, alth&lt;span class="text_exposed_show"&gt;ough  the first pressings of the album on their new label SST Records were  credited to \'Dinosaur\', a lawsuit from a 60\'s rock supergroup by that  name would force the group to change its name to Dinosaur Jr. within  about a month of the album\'s release, and thus it became the first album  to feature the group\'s \'real\' moniker.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="text_exposed_show"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s appropriate, then, that &lt;em&gt;You\'re Living All Over Me&lt;/em&gt; found the group revealing for the first time their signature sound, a  heady blend of classic rock guitar virtuosity, drawling Neil Young-esque  vocals, melody and white noise, not to mention hardcore punk fury and  even a bit of country. J Mascis\' guitar and vocal styles, both very  recognizable now as his, would make him an instant alternative/indie  rock legend, and he\'s in fine form in songs like "Little Fury Things",  "Sludgefeast" and "Raisans". These are only among the best cuts off an  album that\'s strong all the way through, through nine blissful slabs of  white-hot noise-pop and up to the bizarre, almost out-of-place closer  "Poledo", an unnerving lo-fi solo piece from bassist Lou Barlow, who  would soon go on to make similar music with the equally revered Sebadoh  after a particularly ugly split from Dinosaur in 1989.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It  would be far from the last time Dinosaur Jr. would make music this  strong, influential, prescient or unique; 1988\'s follow-up &lt;em&gt;Bug&lt;/em&gt;  (particularly the stone-cold classic "Freak Scene") and their passionate  take on The Cure\'s "Just Like Heaven" make that clear. But with over a  quarter-century\'s hindsight, it\'s also clear that &lt;em&gt;You\'re Living All Over Me&lt;/em&gt; remains Dinosaur\'s finest album, and the one that really built their  standing as one of the best and most influential bands of their time.&lt;/div&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/dinosaur-jr-youre-living-all-over-me.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BemLilqGt2Y/VWY8Rzd_dAI/AAAAAAAAAm8/yhcLxoJ9kMI/s72-c/602275_10201520878926971_2044493015_n.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1985295315005051321</guid><pubdate>Wed, 27 May 2015 21:49:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-27T14:49:11.227-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bikini Kill "Pussy Whipped" (1993)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J1RjjZ3O_-U/VWY7rRsy6lI/AAAAAAAAAm0/rCYSdu7aiT8/s1600/10359151_10202235128462763_5230235295721268604_n.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J1RjjZ3O_-U/VWY7rRsy6lI/AAAAAAAAAm0/rCYSdu7aiT8/s1600/10359151_10202235128462763_5230235295721268604_n.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;By the time the controversial and hugely influential Bikini Kill put  out their first bona fide full-length album in 1993, not counting the  killer previously released &lt;em&gt;First Two Records &lt;/em&gt;compilation that includes all the material from their first EP and their half of the &lt;em&gt;Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah &lt;/em&gt;split  with the British band Huggybear, they had already made a statement that  had seldom been made in punk rock beforehand and continues to resonate  with listeners of all gender identities and sexual orientations today.  Even before the first bar of music on their first EP, lead singer  Kathleen Hanna\'s iconic rallying cry of "we want REVOLUTION, GIRL STYLE  NOW!" set the tone for the rest of the band\'s short but seismic run, and  for the riot grrrl movement that sprung largely from their figurative  loins. The music itself was a ferocious, cacophonous skronk, and Hanna\'s  take-no-prisoners voice gave the white hot rage and indignation of the  lyrics both death-or-glory urgency and a genuinely frightening,  unsettling power. Their material from the ensuing Huggybear split EP was  even more graphic and venomous, and recorded in a more obviously lo-fi  fashion than the songs on their previous record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that, in a way it makes sense that &lt;em&gt;Pussy Whipped&lt;/em&gt;, recorded at the same time that their first EP was just being released and their &lt;em&gt;Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah &lt;/em&gt;songs  were being recorded as well, marked the point where the group began to  spread their musical and lyrical wings just a little bit. Certainly not  enough to in any way abandon or retreat from the radical feminist  politics that still fueled the band\'s every move on and offstage, but  enough to prevent them from beginning to tread the same lyrical waters  as their earlier material with an inevitable lack of the same potency it  might\'ve had the first time around. It boasts the original version of  the self-explanatory classic rock anthem "Rebel Girl", in a different  key than the more well-known, polished Joan Jett produced version that  would be released as a single in 1994, but it also includes more  personal songs like "Alien She", a complicated psychological vignette  from Kathleen about her younger, mallgoing teenage self and the  contradictions between that girl, who wants her to go to the mall and  "put the pretty, pretty red lipstick on", and the "feminist dyke whore"  who wants to kill her, although she\'s afraid she might get killed  herself. There\'s also the surprisingly soft closing track, "For Tammy  Rae", a love letter to the photographer who snapped the album\'s cover  shot, although it wasn\'t actually the first time the group had done such  a song, as evidenced by earlier ones like "Outta Me".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brief, running at less than half an hour long, and brusque, with its spirited, sustained bark against the patriarchy, &lt;em&gt;Pussy Whipped &lt;/em&gt;is  the better of the meager two proper studio albums the group ended up  releasing before its late 90\'s disintegration, and one of the better  records of its era in general. Furthermore, not many of the original  riot grrrl groups ever produced something as consistently interesting  and varied as this album, and that makes it one of the more important  and influential records of its era in a sociopolitical sense as much as  it is musically.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/bikini-kill-pussy-whipped-1993.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-J1RjjZ3O_-U/VWY7rRsy6lI/AAAAAAAAAm0/rCYSdu7aiT8/s72-c/10359151_10202235128462763_5230235295721268604_n.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8719665894608166357</guid><pubdate>Sat, 23 May 2015 04:06:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-22T21:06:47.184-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Jungle Brothers "Straight Out the Jungle" (1988)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D9awBzuiObY/VV4esazJhXI/AAAAAAAAAmA/RPzmxtmnxOw/s1600/Straightoutthejungle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D9awBzuiObY/VV4esazJhXI/AAAAAAAAAmA/RPzmxtmnxOw/s1600/Straightoutthejungle.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Arriving towards the end of a year that stands as the inarguable zenith of hip-hop\'s golden age, the Jungle Brothers\' first album not only marked the introduction of one dope crew on the East Coast scene, it also heralded the beginning of the Native Tongues movement that also included Queen Latifah, De La Soul and A Tribe Called Quest. In fact, in &lt;i&gt;Straight Out the Jungle&lt;/i&gt;\'s classic cut "Black Is Black", their high school buddy Q-Tip makes his first appearance on a record, and his introduction to the song ("Now I\'m from a tribe called \'QUEST\', and I\'m here tonight with the Jungle Brothers...") actually resulted in his group changing their name from having originally just been QUEST. It doesn\'t get much more historically important than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it\'s one of the best records of the era, positively loaded with dope rhymes, smart samples and great songs. Emcees Mike Gee and Afrika Baby Bam were as smooth as Rakim or Big Daddy Kane, but their Afrocentric rhymes were as potent as those of Public Enemy and helped set the standard for socially conscious hip-hop of the late 80\'s and early 90\'s. They update Grandmaster Flash\'s "The Message" with the title track, then Marvin Gaye\'s "What\'s Going On" with their own song of the same name, and then proceed tackle everything from black unity ("Black Is Black") to safe sex ("Jimbrowski"), not to mention all the far less serious stuff that lies in-between. Many other groups of a similar bent would take on these subjects in later years, and the Jungle Brothers were not only one of the first to do just that, but would also remain one of the best, not least because the Brothers never take themselves or the subject matter too seriously. There\'s a playful, block-party vibe that hearkens back to the earliest days of rap music in New York, and it runs throughout the album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the production end, it\'s a wonderfully low-budget, rough-edged sound; the group\'s innovative penchant for jazzy horn samples would help kick-start the entire jazz-rap subgenre, and even their concurrent love affair with James Brown came at a time when producers and DJ\'s (most notably Eric B. and Rakim) were just starting to make the Godfather of Soul one of the most sampled artists of all time. One cut in particular, though, really sounded like no other rap record before it: "I\'ll House You", a collaboration with producer Todd Terry, was one of the very first recordings to bridge the gap between hip-hop and house music, which was just on the cusp of jumping outside of Chicago and over to the United Kingdom in 1988 and wasn\'t quite huge across the US yet to begin with. Over the next several years, similar rap/dance hybrids would burn up the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, and it planted the seed for the advent of trip-hop in the early-to-mid 90\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you\'d understand by now, &lt;i&gt;Straight Out the Jungle&lt;/i&gt; was enormously important and influential, being the very first album from a group out of the revered Native Tongues posse, but there would only be a handful of albums out of that whole movement that would ever be as consistently engaging and outstanding as the Jungle Brothers\' first, and that\'s what matters at the end of the day when it\'s canonized as one of the great hip-hop records of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/jungle-brothers-straight-out-jungle-1988.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D9awBzuiObY/VV4esazJhXI/AAAAAAAAAmA/RPzmxtmnxOw/s72-c/Straightoutthejungle.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-668894659469383585</guid><pubdate>Thu, 14 May 2015 23:10:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-14T16:10:36.041-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>3rd Bass "The Cactus Album" (1989)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uphCNxq8VqE/VVUe4W472ZI/AAAAAAAAAlU/9J9YgLGOUgk/s1600/3rdBassTheCactusAlbum.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uphCNxq8VqE/VVUe4W472ZI/AAAAAAAAAlU/9J9YgLGOUgk/s1600/3rdBassTheCactusAlbum.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Despite the almost shocking commercial and critical success of the Beastie Boys, who fused rap/hip-hop with a snotty suburban punk aesthetic and attitude, and despite the fact that the audience for rap was making huge inroads into white suburbia by 1989, hip-hop culture was still almost exclusively the province of black men at the end of the 80\'s. In its own way, 3rd Bass\' &lt;i&gt;Cactus Album &lt;/i&gt;might have been even more revelatory and prescient than the Beasties\' &lt;i&gt;Licensed to Ill&lt;/i&gt;, in that it was an LP dominated by incomparably funky sounds (courtesy of the legendary Prince Paul, in tandem with members of The Bomb Squad) and commanded by two ace emcees, and it just so happened both of those emcees were white boys from New York, and they sound like it too. Where, upon the release of their first album, many people easily mistook the Beasties for a bunch of snarky white rock kids doing a big, loud parody of black rap music, 3rd Bass came out with neither those obvious hallmarks of a punk rock past or any attempt to pretend to be black kids from the ghetto, which is mighty impressive. In doing that, &lt;i&gt;The Cactus Album&lt;/i&gt; helped open the door for white kids to start taking on hip-hop as performers and DJ\'s, rather than just eager listeners, without succumbing to embarrassing cultural appropriation or poseurism, making it an important watershed in the music\'s spread from black ghettos in America throughout the whole wide multicultural world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would be enough to make 3rd Bass\' debut a landmark, but it also just so happens to be a stone-cold classic of hip-hop\'s golden age when the race card is put away entirely. It may have been a golden age that produced scores of remarkably talented individuals and fantastic music, but even then there were still few rappers of any color who were as inventive, nimble or clever as MC Serch and Pete Nice; Serch is the goofy loudmouth who came up with a nifty slang term that made for the title of the album\'s one minor hit single, "The Gas Face", and the no-nonsense Pete gives off all the flippant, hair-trigger arrogance of a young mobster. Both of them have a way with words that most rappers would still kill for today, over a quarter-century after this album was waxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To many casual listeners, "The Gas Face" would probably be the most recognizable cut off the album, and taken together with a very funny music video, that\'s nothing to lament, but the real high-watermark is a pair of anthems that arrive near the end of the record, "Brooklyn-Queens" and "Steppin\' to the A.M." The former is a sunny, funny yarn about scoring with stuck-up girls out of the maligned Queens Bridge, and the latter is its nocturnal, hard-hitting flipside, which is sure to rock any party it happens to drop into to this day. Elsewhere, the boys diss their ex-labelmates the Beasties in "Sons of 3rd Bass" ("Swarm to the lyrics cause Serch is your father/Screaming "Hey Ladies", why bother?"), send up jazz legend (and unwitting rap granddaddy) Louis Armstrong in "Flippin\' Off the Wall Like Lucy Ball", and repeatedly indulge in very brief skits that draw from Wild West mythology and black &amp;amp; white television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They wind up with one of the greatest, most audacious debut albums in rap history, and a masterwork that 3rd Bass would never approach in what little time afterward they would remain active. They only made one more album, 1991\'s &lt;i&gt;Derelicts of Dialect&lt;/i&gt;, and although it produced their biggest chart hit in "Pop Goes the Weasel" (savaging Vanilla Ice), it wouldn\'t quite hit the same perfect-pitch note as its predecessor when taken together as a whole. It didn\'t matter; with &lt;i&gt;The Cactus Album&lt;/i&gt;, 3rd Bass helped pave the way for a world in which hip-hop has taken rock\'s place as the dominant music of America\'s multiracial youth culture, for better or for worse, and that alone makes it one of the most important albums of the last 25 years.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/3rd-bass-cactus-album-1989.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uphCNxq8VqE/VVUe4W472ZI/AAAAAAAAAlU/9J9YgLGOUgk/s72-c/3rdBassTheCactusAlbum.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5699298151014505371</guid><pubdate>Sun, 10 May 2015 07:45:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-10T00:45:56.488-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Billie Holiday "Lady in Satin" (1958)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tfoSHahwowk/VU8EXmaZFNI/AAAAAAAAAko/cbeCnNbmveM/s1600/220px-LadyInSatin.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tfoSHahwowk/VU8EXmaZFNI/AAAAAAAAAko/cbeCnNbmveM/s1600/220px-LadyInSatin.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Near the end of a relentlessly tormented life, and by turn a tumultuous singing career, Lady Day was perhaps more famous than she had ever been, thanks largely to the publication of her (now largely discredited and/or factually disputed) autobiography "Lady Sings the Blues" and its accompanying album in 1956. But her personal life was falling apart, due to increasing drug and alcohol abuse and accompanying legal problems that were brought on by a nasty Federal Bureau of Narcotics campaign that did much to eventually hasten her ugly demise. By 1958, Billie\'s ethereal pipes had taken a beating from all the hard living, and the &lt;i&gt;Lady in Satin &lt;/i&gt;LP, which was the final album to be released during her lifetime and penultimate to be recorded, painfully spotlights her condition with some of the saddest and most moving performances of her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this day, many feel that Ray Ellis\' orchestral arrangements and strings took away from the raw power of Billie\'s voice, even though it was certainly not the first time she had been accompanied by this type of backing. But from the first craggy, weary words out of her mouth on "I\'m a Fool to Want You", any such griping really ought to be put away; Holiday had always been a slightly unconventional singer who would willfully twist her voice in ways that hadn\'t been heard before in popular music, and although her perfectly imperfect take here wasn\'t really a deliberate artistic statement so much as the result of the aforementioned self-abuse, it makes for a brutally honest, devastating performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the remaining ten cuts are all exactly the same way, although prime highlights include "You\'ve Changed", "Glad to Be Unhappy" and "I\'ll Be Around". The whole thing is made particularly sad by how it would come to pass that Billie\'s voice would never be this strong again, as evidenced by her train-wreck final album simply titled &lt;i&gt;Last Recordings&lt;/i&gt;, which was recorded just months before her death in July 1959 and released almost immediately thereafter. &lt;i&gt;Lady in Satin &lt;/i&gt;truly is, as The Penguin Guide to Jazz once described it, "a voyeuristic look at a beaten woman", and over half a century after she succumbed to a nasty habit and a malicious government effort to do her in, it\'s still one of the most emotionally affecting pieces of American popular music.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/billie-holiday-lady-in-satin-1958.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tfoSHahwowk/VU8EXmaZFNI/AAAAAAAAAko/cbeCnNbmveM/s72-c/220px-LadyInSatin.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3758346766706767799</guid><pubdate>Tue, 05 May 2015 03:56:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-05-04T20:56:00.532-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Isaac Hayes "Hot Buttered Soul" (1969)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jLYj3i4j_vQ/VUgpU-dKosI/AAAAAAAAAkE/R8qrwrvSZY4/s1600/220px-Isaac_Hayes%2C_Hot_Buttered_Soul_Album_Cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jLYj3i4j_vQ/VUgpU-dKosI/AAAAAAAAAkE/R8qrwrvSZY4/s1600/220px-Isaac_Hayes%2C_Hot_Buttered_Soul_Album_Cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;It\'s bizarre to think that a bona-fide masterpiece like &lt;i&gt;Hot Buttered Soul &lt;/i&gt;would result from a record label\'s frantic attempt to get back on its feet. It was bad enough when Otis Redding and members of The Bar-Kays perished in a tragic plane crash on December 10, 1967, but to make matters worse for Stax Records, just months later their entire back catalog would become property of Atlantic Records after a messy split from the larger label. Stax exec Al Bell ordered an absolute wash-out of 27 albums and 30 singles, all to be released at once, with all of the label\'s artists to immediately record new material. Isaac Hayes was a longtime in-house songwriter and producer, who might have stayed in that position had this mandate not occurred; Hayes\' debut album as a performer, &lt;i&gt;Presenting Isaac Hayes&lt;/i&gt;, had flopped commercially and garnered little critical notice. In this rush to get Stax back on track, Hayes was able to demand complete creative control when he went into Ardent Studios in Memphis to record another album, and the end result (embellished with string arrangements quite ironically in the Motor City by Johnny Allen prior to release) was quite a good many miles away from the kind of gritty, aggressive and single-oriented southern soul the label had once specialized in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hot Buttered Soul &lt;/i&gt;was a landmark release in the evolution of soul music, starting off with an absolutely breathtaking reading of Dionne Warwick\'s "Walk On By" that vamps all the way up to the twelve-minute mark. The original was a high-drama mini-masterwork of the Brill Building era to begin with, but Hayes turns it into an epic, sweeping piece of pure anguish, never once losing steam across those twelve minutes, a length that was still quite rare in R&amp;amp;B music in 1969, if not completely unprecedented at that point. Soul had never been quite this grandiose or cinematic before, an innovation which would be built upon by the likes of Marvin Gaye with &lt;i&gt;What\'s Going On &lt;/i&gt;and Curtis Mayfield with his solo debut &lt;i&gt;Curtis&lt;/i&gt; over the next couple of years, not to mention the lush "Philadelphia Sound" that became hugely successful on both the R&amp;amp;B and pop charts in the mid-70\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Walk On By" would be enough to make this record a classic, but the slightly shorter "Hyperbolicsyllabicsesquedalymistic" manages to be another stunner, another monumental vamp that captures everything great about soul music itself. It gets right back down to the nasty, funky grit of Stax\'s glory days, while at the same time continuing to shatter boundaries of song structure and length, to say nothing of its tongue-twister title. A sampled bit of rolling piano from the extended instrumental coda would later power Public Enemy\'s classic "Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos", which is no doubt how many listeners who weren\'t around yet when Hayes cut his masterpiece discovered his music when they began working backwards, using PE and the Bomb Squad\'s expertly chosen, sampleadelic reference points as a guidebook to delve into deep soul and funk. His memorable and very, very funny voice acting role as The Chef on South Park would have to take the most cake for re-introducing him to younger audiences, but I digress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After these two epically long highlights, which constitute side one on the original LP version of the album, the five-minute "One Woman" is the most conventional number here, and just as gorgeous as the rest of it. And just as audaciously as it begins, &lt;i&gt;Hot Buttered Soul &lt;/i&gt;ends with its most adventurous cut, the 18-minute take on Jimmy Webb\'s "By the Time I Get to Phoenix". The first eight-and-a-half minutes consist of Hayes delivering a compelling monologue which fleshes out a vividly detailed backstory for the tune, and as with "Walk On By", when he finally gets around to his rendition of the actual song he transforms it into a sweeping, orchestral epic that reaches a devastating emotional climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With just one album, Isaac Hayes cemented in place a whole new sound for soul music, his own penchant for lengthy onstage banter to introduce songs, and an enduring image as one of the great R&amp;amp;B love men for all time, and he made one of the best soul albums of all time on top of all that, which makes &lt;i&gt;Hot Buttered Soul &lt;/i&gt;an essential item.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/05/isaac-hayes-hot-buttered-soul-1969.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jLYj3i4j_vQ/VUgpU-dKosI/AAAAAAAAAkE/R8qrwrvSZY4/s72-c/220px-Isaac_Hayes%2C_Hot_Buttered_Soul_Album_Cover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-187236331409107175</guid><pubdate>Sun, 26 Apr 2015 15:40:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-04-26T08:40:07.974-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Black Sheep "A Wolf in Sheep\'s Clothing" (1991)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FjN2pQ9AZKU/VTz-a6dbixI/AAAAAAAAAjU/7w_R2beEW-4/s1600/MI0002805792.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FjN2pQ9AZKU/VTz-a6dbixI/AAAAAAAAAjU/7w_R2beEW-4/s1600/MI0002805792.jpg" height="314" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Black Sheep describe themselves as, well, just that among the Native Tongues alternative hip-hop community (De La Soul, Tribe Called Quest, Jungle Brothers) in their bizarre, gross-out spoken intro to their excellent 1991 debut album &lt;i&gt;A Wolf in Sheep\'s Clothing&lt;/i&gt;, which just might be the funniest and most clever record from any Native Tongues group, as well as one of the best. The intro is a bit of a chuckle, but the album really begins with the absolutely hilarious, comically ultraviolent gangsta rap parody "U Mean I\'m Not" which would apparently later be a regular part of Korn\'s live repertoire. One wonders whether or not they got the joke, and with the same token one ponders that when thinking of the hordes of increasingly hackneyed, cookie-cutter thug-rappers that would eventually come to dominate the hip-hop community and become the most commercially viable aspect of the culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As sidesplitting as it may be at times, &lt;i&gt;A Wolf in Sheep\'s Clothing &lt;/i&gt;is hardly a comedy album. Its humor is thoroughly smart and self-deprecating, and much of the time the joke is on them and their own culture. By the looks of it, a whole lot of people are out to whoop the duo\'s asses here; despite tunes like "Strobelite Honey" and "Hoes We Knows", their misogyny level was kept at a sensible minimum compared to the likes of N.W.A. or 2 Live Crew, but just try telling that to "Ladies Against Sexist Motherfuckers" when they take these Black Sheep to task. They get the same treatment from Afrocentric thinkers in "Are You Mad?", and in both instances they manage to escape unharmed. It was an almost tiresomely (though justifiable) complaint by this point in hip-hop culture, but they take rappers who sell out to task on "To Whom it May Concern".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They tout the merits of a "Similak Child" over an ominous sample from Jefferson Airplane\'s "Today" and deliver one of the best rap singles of 1991 with "The Choice is Yours", including two versions on this record, but for the most part they simply position themselves as a couple of easygoing, bumbling playboys who are as good on the mic as they are with the ladies, as well as a pair of outcasts in a community that was increasingly split between the two extremes of gangsta rap\'s unbridled violence and the self-serious, socially conscious end of alternative rap. Coming from a goofy, yet intelligent gap in the canyon, &lt;i&gt;A Wolf in Sheep\'s Clothing &lt;/i&gt;is one of the best records of its time, a refreshing breath of fresh air that came at a time when rap music was already starting to become predictable and marketable. Lord knows the hip-hop and music world in general could use a record like this one in 2015.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/04/black-sheep-wolf-in-sheeps-clothing-1991.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FjN2pQ9AZKU/VTz-a6dbixI/AAAAAAAAAjU/7w_R2beEW-4/s72-c/MI0002805792.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-31782502232079565</guid><pubdate>Sat, 25 Apr 2015 20:44:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-04-25T13:44:33.751-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Boogie Down Productions "By All Means Necessary" (1988)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BHOMItPftfs/VTia7VWh5jI/AAAAAAAAAis/RfEGyvFmyT0/s1600/220px-BDPByAllMeans.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BHOMItPftfs/VTia7VWh5jI/AAAAAAAAAis/RfEGyvFmyT0/s1600/220px-BDPByAllMeans.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;DJ Scott La Rock\'s senseless, sudden shooting death on August 27, 1987 shook his Boogie Down Productions cohort KRS-One to the core, causing him to rethink his lyrical focus and restart BDP as an essentially solo project, adopting the persona of "The Teacher" in the process and spelling out the change in attitude from the unbridled brashness of BDP\'s landmark first album &lt;i&gt;Criminal Minded&lt;/i&gt; in the opening track ("My Philosophy") of the group\'s sophomore album, &lt;i&gt;By All Means Necessary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where he had once been the first MC to pose on the cover of an album with a gun and one of the first to inject dancehall reggae into his rapping, KRS-One was now possibly the first to tout Krishna-Conscious vegetarianism and disdain competition in the hip-hop culture, and that\'s just in the first track. As on BDP\'s previous album, KRS has a gun in his hand on the front cover, but now he\'s only mimicking a famous photograph of Malcolm X. In "I\'m Still #1", he criticizes those who would call themselves kings of a culture that wasn\'t even two decades old back in \'88, and correctly predicts that guys like him will one day be seen as rap\'s old school. In "Illegal Business", he outlines the US government\'s ties to the drug trade in brutal and exacting terms, touching right on a contemporary wave of controversy that blighted the ass-end of Ronald Reagan\'s presidency over alleged CIA involvement in cocaine trafficking, which would come further to light in later years with investigative journalist Gary Webb\'s incendiary 1996 "Dark Alliance" series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He could\'ve simplistically reversed his earlier braggadocio and morphed into an obnoxious preacher spouting cliched slogans, which critics would soon accuse him of doing at the turn of the 90\'s as he slowly faded from prominence in a then-rapidly evolving rap scene, but he loses none of the self-assured swagger that\'s been a hip-hop tradition from the beginning. Both the putdowns of "Ya Slippin\'" and his pleas for peace in the surprisingly (or perhaps unfortunately) enduring anthem "Stop the Violence" resonate today, and that\'s why &lt;i&gt;By All Means Necessary &lt;/i&gt;is undeniably as much of a stone-cold classic as its predecessor. On any side left or right of Public Enemy, politically conscious hip-hop simply doesn\'t get much better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/04/boogie-down-productions-by-all-means.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BHOMItPftfs/VTia7VWh5jI/AAAAAAAAAis/RfEGyvFmyT0/s72-c/220px-BDPByAllMeans.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8092503632616370226</guid><pubdate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 06:56:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-04-22T23:56:23.882-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Boogie Down Productions "Criminal Minded" (1987)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MUb3lpoIMO0/VTiKlB90NuI/AAAAAAAAAic/q4wPWwgatFA/s1600/Criminal_Minded_Album_Cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MUb3lpoIMO0/VTiKlB90NuI/AAAAAAAAAic/q4wPWwgatFA/s1600/Criminal_Minded_Album_Cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Released in early 1987 with relatively little initial notice on the indie label B-Boy Records, as tiny as it was shady, &lt;i&gt;Criminal Minded&lt;/i&gt; upped the ante on the latent violence and aggression that was already bubbling to the surface in rap (check Schoolly D\'s "P.S.K." and Ice-T\'s "Six in the Mornin\'", both of which were released earlier), and as such it\'s still cited as one of the cornerstone records of hardcore hip-hop, as well as a key progenitor of gangsta rap. As great as the music is, its most striking innovation wasn\'t even the music itself, but the album\'s cover art; it was the very first hip-hop record with a group posed packing pistols on the front cover, making for a genuinely startling statement in the rap community of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comprised initially of the fiery MC KRS-One and the skillful DJ Scott La Rock, Boogie Down Productions would soon shift to a much more socially conscious, politically-minded focus after La Rock\'s tragic murder just months after the release of &lt;i&gt;Criminal Minded&lt;/i&gt;, but here, KRS bore out blunt street reportage ("9mm Goes Bang", "Remix for P is Free") and nasty attacks, particularly on the Queens-based MC Shan ("South Bronx", "The Bridge is Over"). All of it is supported by Scott La Rock\'s brutally spare, hard-hitting beats, communicating urban decay and savage realism as effectively as their nascent West Coast gangsta contemporaries. By far the album\'s apex is "9mm Goes Bang"; KRS\' singsong reggae-rap, which as a vocal delivery made him among the first rappers to explicitly acknowledge rap\'s roots in the sounds of Jamaica, pairs with the graphic violence depicted in his words ("Me knew a crack dealer, his name was Peter/Had to buck him down with my nine milometer") to make for something that remains as disturbing as it was in 1987. In contrast to the in-your-face thuggishness of an Ice Cube or an Ice-T, he describes the gunplay and bloodshed so casually and playfully as to send a chill up anyone\'s spine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the unapologetic arrogance and nastiness would quickly recede into the past with La Rock\'s death and KRS-One\'s subsequent reinvention as "The Teacher", as was perhaps inevitable, since the worst aspects of ghetto life never quite make themselves as apparent as when the death and violence at its heart comes straight to your house, so to speak. But &lt;i&gt;Criminal Minded&lt;/i&gt; captures that street-level vibe better than nearly any other album of its time, and it\'s no wonder that it\'s still a stone-cold rap/hip-hop classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/04/boogie-down-productions-criminal-minded.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MUb3lpoIMO0/VTiKlB90NuI/AAAAAAAAAic/q4wPWwgatFA/s72-c/Criminal_Minded_Album_Cover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6551316349138704728</guid><pubdate>Thu, 23 Apr 2015 05:09:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-04-22T22:09:35.629-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Nas "Illmatic" (1994)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lJ-IhPGHE1c/VThvNdYCMnI/AAAAAAAAAiM/JCWn88DfGcM/s1600/220px-NasIllmatic.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lJ-IhPGHE1c/VThvNdYCMnI/AAAAAAAAAiM/JCWn88DfGcM/s1600/220px-NasIllmatic.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In hip-hop culture, authenticity and "keepin\' it real" have always been among the most important attributes of an MC who\'s a cut or two above the rest of the pack. In a roughly ten-year period that saw this nascent form of music evolve at a startlingly fast pace, producing scores of amazing talents and classic albums, few artists got their point across as forcefully and concisely as Nasir bin Olu Dara Jones did on his remarkable debut LP, 1994\'s &lt;i&gt;Illmatic&lt;/i&gt;, which still stands as one of the greatest and most influential rap albums of all time. Unlike many hip-hop full-lengths, from the junky commercial blockbusters to the acclaimed avant-garde opuses, &lt;i&gt;Illmatic &lt;/i&gt;just about makes the 40 minute mark, in contrast to the standard 50-100 minute running time that\'s common to many albums of the CD age in general. This results in a positively dynamite sequence of ten songs, not broken up by any filler material of any type, all chock-filled with detail and somber depictions of the blighted New York in which "Nasty Nas" (as he was originally dubbed when the incendiary "Halftime" was originally released as a single, over a year and a half before the album) came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As chronicled in the bitter "N.Y. State of Mind", Nas was a prominent member of a new generation of rappers coming up in the early-to-mid 1990\'s, who had survived the inner-city crack epidemic that was finally waning by the time they made their debut on wax and which informed the rhymes of everything from the graphic, cold accounts of fellow New Yorkers Wu-Tang Clan and The Notorious B.I.G. to the widescreen gangsta grooves of West Coasters like Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur. His references to shootouts, dope dealing and crackheads were anything but unprecedented by 1994, and continue to be mined endlessly as subject matter for a huge passel of MC\'s (of varying quality and/or credibility) to this day, but few people were ever as unfailingly human, compassionate or matter-of-fact in their words and in the sound surrounding them. Some of his words are so striking, they practically jump out of the speakers: "I never sleep cause sleep is the cousin of death", "I\'m out for dead presidents to represent me", "Some rest in the pieces/Some are sitting in San Quentin". It\'s a heady, startling mirror reflection of a frame of mind where you\'d better focus on the good in life, because your life could very well end as soon as you get done rocking the mic on any given night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would be hard-pressed to think of compassion when listening to the hard-edged "State of Mind" or "Halftime", or the equally ethereal, grim, and underrated "Life\'s a Bitch", but in "One Love", he writes a letter to one of his mates in the lockup, who becomes a father while doing a six-year bid. Without succumbing to melodrama or cliche, it brings home the sad reality of the lengthy prison terms that so many young African-American men in particular have wound up with as a result of a life of crime, one that seemed especially all too easy (and appealing) to turn to at a time when the crack cocaine game really was the number one employer of ghetto youth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\'s absolutely no glamor or theater in this music, spare and basic, with no flash to the beats or the overall engineering. With the assistance of well-established jazz-rap producers Q-Tip, Pete Rock, Large Professor and DJ Premier, Nas creates a gritty, grim sound that, when taken with the words and his effortless flow, envelops the listener in his world. As tough as he may be, he never pretends to be larger-than-life or to be any tougher than his homeboys, many of whom were already dead by the time he began his now-storied career at the age of just 18. The indisputable authenticity and truthfulness that flow like his rhymes through the entirety of&lt;i&gt; Illmatic &lt;/i&gt;immediately made him stand out in the crowd when the album was released, and it captures a purity of expression that was never captured in quite this way again. That\'s why it\'s still not only one of the best pieces of work to come out of hip-hop, but it\'s also one of the best and most influential albums of both its time and all-time in popular music.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/04/nas-illmatic-1994.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lJ-IhPGHE1c/VThvNdYCMnI/AAAAAAAAAiM/JCWn88DfGcM/s72-c/220px-NasIllmatic.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8040041662821890806</guid><pubdate>Mon, 06 Apr 2015 06:57:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-04-05T23:57:02.312-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Life Stories</category><title>We Were the Best (Enjoy Poverty, Dumbass Hipsters)</title><description>It\'s really hard to believe how old I am now. Being 20 years old, which I will be on the third of June this year, is by no stretch of the imagination "old", even in fashion or "entertainment industry" terms. I won\'t be able to legally buy alcohol for another whole year after that. But it still marks the end of your "teen years", those years which are supposed to be so great but usually seem to wind up as a predominantly turbulent and unhappy (though undeniably crucial) time in your life, and there\'s something to be said of the changes (most) people undergo from the age of 16 to 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These changes are different for everybody, but for one thing out of my own life, I lost both my maternal grandparents in the span of two months towards the end of 2013, shortly after I would\'ve graduated high school and shortly before I would get my GED diploma in December. I was very close to them, particularly my grandma Kathy, who died suddenly of a heart attack on the 18th of October that year, in contrast to her husband Dale, who had died exactly two months to the day earlier after months of battling cancer of the esophagus and narrowly cheating seemingly certain death several times along the way. I\'m not gonna turn on the sap and tell you it was "the end of my childhood", despite the almost poignant timing, being after all just after I had legally become an "adult". But it did seem to represent the end of my boyhood in a profound enough way; by the time grandma died, I was no longer able to take those "vacations" I used to have at her house for anywhere from a few days to over two weeks at a time, thanks to having recently started working my very first paying job at Papa John\'s in Coralville, Iowa, where my orientation also just so happened to have been the day after grandpa died. Those visits had already been declining in number since the beginning of the previous year, because of what a busy social life I had at that point, and for the most part I didn\'t want to be spending a week at my grandma\'s house anymore anyway, but this was something where I was required to show up at a certain time on XYZ days and be there for a set amount of time. I hadn\'t had that type of commitment for most of my life up to then. Since I didn\'t really "need" money at that time, the job was very part-time and usually only took about 12 hours out out of an average week, but it still very much represented the dawning of a new era in my life after the near-completely responsibility-free existence I had enjoyed from early childhood thanks to being essentially unschooled, which had a few social disadvantages later on but afforded me almost unlimited free time to do whatever I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as I write this, I\'m working five days a week at the Coralville Walmart, putting in a solid forty hours every week with only two measly days to myself, though there have been the occasional three-day weekends and a few "sick" call-in days that were more fib than legit. I\'m doing that many hours because these days I actually need the much more substantial pay checks in order to afford $500 per month in rent, not to mention food when my EBT card is empty, and the only reason I\'m paying only $500 is because my mother is leasing my place (not living here, though) and so I pay her a slight reduction of what the full cost is combined with utilities and the cellphone bill that my parents often lump together with "your total expenses". It\'s not such a bad life. I\'ve gotten used to it, and inevitably I\'ve learned to appreciate free time so much more than I did when there was virtually no limit to it. But when I watch a movie like "We Are the Best!", which I saw for the first time tonight and which is a great Swedish film about three thirteen-year-old girls who form a punk band in the early 80\'s, it really brings out all that misty eyed nostalgia crap from within the uber-sentimental dude that will probably always lurk just beneath the surface for the rest of my life. Specifically, for when I was 15, 16, 17 years old: hanging out with my best mates, going to&amp;nbsp; DIY punk shows with them whenever we could, sleeping over at eachother\'s houses, and all that other great stuff that I don\'t do so often nowadays. It doesn\'t hurt that in the movie, a youth center plays an important role in shaping the girls in the band and their resolve to do what they do no matter what obstacles stand in their way, and it serves as a primary focal point in its very funny and very sweet ending; I can\'t help but be reminded of how my life back in those days was centered more often than not on hanging out at the United Action for Youth center in Iowa City, which has among other things nurtured musically inclined kids for decades with a rehearsal room, recording equipment and instrument lessons. Recently on one of those "sick days", I saw "SLC Punk!" for the first time since I was 16 or 17 and it gave me the same feeling, even moreso because it had been a favorite of all of ours among the little social group I had back then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Particularly, "We Are the Best!" reminds me of meeting a guy who\'s been a friend longer than most other people I know outside of blood relatives, and how we started a band that may have undeniably sucked ass but would undoubtedly alter our immediate futures not only as musicians, but also as people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had seen this kid around the UAY center a few times before. It was mid-late November of 2010. I\'d just started hanging out there regularly again after about a year where in the span of twelve months\' time I had only been inside once for like two minutes or something. He was a scrawny black guy who was always riffing on one of the center\'s acoustic guitars. One day he had left his City High School student ID in the UAY\'s jam room, and I went outside to where he was holding court with a few friends to give it back to him. His name was Detrell Smith. The first time we really spoke was maybe two days later, when I stopped by after picking up a vinyl copy of the first Ramones album at the local record shop, which I told my dad was a "half present" for mom cause she dug the Ramones as much as I did (and still do). I was sort of not supposed to be buying stuff for myself because it was the month before Christmas and I was supposed to be buying gifts for people, a hokey "tradition" that hadn\'t really been in effect the previous November or December because my folks weren\'t giving me weekly allowance money anyway during the holiday season that year, and wouldn\'t be repeated again. I was talking to a UAY staffmember about my mom liking the Ramones, and that\'s when he chimed in with, "Your mom likes the Ramones? That\'s really cool." It was our very first conversation, and by the end of that day he had invited me to sing for a recording session he had booked in the UAY jam room/studio that was coming up in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was essentially no rehearsal for the occasion, at least not with me. All that had been decided was that I was going to sing my song "I\'m Mental" along with a few other songs we were just gonna pick on the fly with him playing guitar and his friend playing the drums. It wasn\'t until I showed up for the session that I met that friend, Max Bills, who was an equally scrawny Jewish guy with blonde hair that went down past his shoulders and very briefly made me sort of half-wonder whether or not he was male or female, or if he was a transperson of some kind or another. I didn\'t even know it at the time, but Max later told me that it was essentially the first time he had ever played drums. We did "I\'m Mental", the Ramones\' "Blitzkrieg Bop" and a cover of New Zealand punk band The Rabble\'s song "I\'m Bored" where Detrell took the lead vocal. The performances were pretty much incompetent even by punk rock standards, but they were enormously fun to do, and it was my first ever recording session. We had the makings of a band, and I came up with the name The Tea Party, after the insufferable extreme-right wing group that continues to subject Americans to some of the most baseless and idiotic political banter that anyone has ever been able to muster up, but a semi obscure Canadian group already had dibs on that name and released records years before, and because I thought we were actually going to get recognition and face legal action from this other group, I changed it to The Tea Party Fascists. A month later it was changed again, to The No. Again, I had originally intended to use something else, in this case No Means No, but again another band had dibs on the name years before, in this case one that turned out to be the very well-respected and well-known punk rock trio that by sheer bizarre coincidence were also from Canada.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under our revised moniker, we went back in the studio in March with barely any more rehearsal than had been done the first time around, and the only thing that had changed is that we were now &lt;i&gt;hilariously &lt;/i&gt;awful, not just instrumentally inept in a more basic, garden-variety way as had been the case before. Well, that, and we had added the bass player Martin Herrera, a very quiet guy who would eventually become quite surprisingly proficient after this little group fizzled out. He\'s since put down the instrument and joined the US Army, apparently. All playing live in the same room, with no vocals tracked separately, resulting in a hilariously disjointed sound to my singing on the new version of "I\'m Mental". We also did a song, sung by Detrell and Max, that they had written called "What?" on which I supplied slightly out of tune rhythm guitar to back up Detrell\'s riffing. The funniest moment was a horribly hackneyed "macho" Rolling Stones-meets-Modern Lovers-meets-Velvet Underground tune called "My Back Seat", which was this big dumbass lascivious come on to a fictional girl in the backseat of my fictional car. Detrell and Max later marked this song, with its lack of a real dynamic backbeat, terrible lyrics and all around boring ass structure, as the main reason they split off from me almost immediately after the session and started a "side-project" called Other Band which eventually roped in Martin when The No inevitably "broke up" in April upon Detrell\'s "quitting" our failed attempt at a band. We never played a gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By no means had we stopped being friends, though; we still hung out all the time, although at the time Max sort of pissed me off cause he would say things like "man, your songwriting sucks" more than was needed for me to understand that "My Back Seat" was a total piece of shit. Other Band rehearsed incessantly, all summer, during which time I had stopped going to UAY as often, and eventually went up onstage at the center just a few days before Halloween to do their first ever show. As it turned out, another reason they had split to do their own thing was that they were more interested in playing hyper fast ska and pop-punk inflected stuff, a la Operation Ivy and Rancid, whereas I was already interested in many types of music aside from punk and had been for over a year prior to when we all met. As much as it wasn\'t really my thing, they mimicked that ska-punk sound with tremendous enthusiasm and were a &lt;i&gt;much&lt;/i&gt; tighter band than the one they had been in with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning of 2012, I once again began going to the UAY every day it was open during the week, which was Thursday, Friday and Saturday afternoons, to be more specific 3-7pm for the first two of those days and then from noon till 5pm on Saturdays. The main reason at the time was that I had a crush on a girl I met in mid-January who would soon form another punk band that became quite popular in Iowa City, even moreso than Other Band as a matter of fact, but seeing as that crush was one-sided, would soon spawn much friction and ultimately lead to the shittiest times I had during my UAY-going years, these days I prefer to look back on the times I spent that year hanging out with Max and/or Detrell not only at UAY but also at my house, Max\'s house or Detrell\'s house depending on the night. Sometimes being at Detrell\'s wound up being a lousy night for me because at the time he lived with his grandfather, and he had this "rule" of "no swearing at my house" because he said he respected his grandpa too much or something like that, which irritated me more than it really should\'ve. On a side note, I also recorded two EP\'s of predominantly Black Flag-derived punk at the UAY during this time, and although I don\'t really like them anymore they were the only "proper" recordings that were really released out of the relative wealth of material I recorded there over the years. It was definitely at once both the peak of that whole period of life, and also the biggest downer of the time because of the other stuff that happened, which by the end of 2012 eventually encompassed other dramas that wound up ending my friendship with Max and briefly ending it with Detrell for brief periods of time over the following year after that. The last time I was at UAY was back in May 2013, weeks before I turned 18. On various occasions since then I\'ve meant to stop in and just say hi to some of the staffpeople I made good friends with, but on each of these occasions bad weather conditions usually thwarted those plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\'s one memory I have of hanging out with Max, Detrell and a few others in the hours between UAY closing on a Saturday and the start of a show we were all going to later that night at Public Space One, which is a long-running art &amp;amp; music co-op type deal that was housed at the Jefferson Building in Iowa City at the time and would move to a different location in town the following summer. It was September of 2012, and football season was kicking back into gear that very day, as evidenced by the hordes of what I call "football heathens" parading through downtown all day. Their whole dumbass rah-rah "PAAAAARTAY, WOOOO!!!" thing even crept into PS1 at the show; the venue didn\'t allow drinking on the premises, nor does it today at its current location, but some guy came in super drunk already and was obnoxiously crowdsurfing and making a real jackass of himself early on during the show. Shortly before it began, as me and the rest of our little motley crew were hanging out in an alleyway some ways from PS1, a couple of musclebound and shirtless jock douchebags passed us by and one of them remarked something along the lines of: "Dumbass hipster punks, enjoy your poverty", probably accompanied by some bad fag joke or something. I said something like, "you keep passing your football around, man."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was one of the funniest memories of my "youth", which is hardly over now in the grand scheme of things since I\'m only just about to turn 20, but sometimes it feels like I\'m turning into "a man" in the most predictable, boring sense already, which is mainly just because of how so much of my time is taken up by working at Walmart. I\'m still friends with Detrell, who also works pretty frequently in night stock at HyVee in Iowa City, so we\'re kind of on an even keel in that respect. The same pretty much goes for Max, I\'m told, though we\'ve hardly spoken since the end of 2012 for a variety of reasons. I\'m getting back into the swing of the scene now, albeit not in the way it used to be in that, for one thing, I\'m well past the age of the kids who are welcome to hang out at UAY on a regular basis, as are the two founding members of Other Band, who now have a different, younger bassist. I don\'t hang at PS1 anymore and am no longer a "hardcore kid", which I could sort of comfortably classify myself as for much of the time I was 17 even though I was always listening to other kinds of music as well. I guess that was the story of how at one time with those original mates, even long after we were no longer in a band together, "we were the best!" And regardless of the negative bits, considerable though some may be, I\'ll always think fondly of the whole time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/04/we-were-best-enjoy-poverty-dumbass.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-133772442507284414</guid><pubdate>Sun, 29 Mar 2015 21:45:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-29T14:49:25.989-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pere Ubu "Terminal Tower" (1985)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyJGjxWESN0/VRhmMgpzuJI/AAAAAAAAAgU/Qf1Ex88TfJU/s1600/MI0000032900.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyJGjxWESN0/VRhmMgpzuJI/AAAAAAAAAgU/Qf1Ex88TfJU/s1600/MI0000032900.jpg" height="320" width="318" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When listening to the first three tracks on &lt;i&gt;Terminal Tower: An Archival Collection&lt;/i&gt;, it\'s still startling to think that they were all recorded in 1975, before punk proper had come to fruition and well before the experimentalism of post-punk. Even more astonishing is how Pere Ubu formed their own tiny label, Hearthan Records to release their debut single, "Heart of Darkness" backed with "30 Seconds Over Tokyo", a good number of years before the American hardcore punk underground sprang up from California, Washington D.C. and all across the country powered entirely by self-sufficient indie labels like SST, Dischord Records and Alternative Tentacles. They set themselves apart from the pack from the very beginning, and have remained one of the most thoroughly unique and undefinable, ever-shifting musical entities around, in a career that\'s been on and off for the past four decades now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the talk about how far-reaching and prescient they were would be worth a shit if their music wasn\'t as surprising, challenging and totally compelling as it is. "Heart of Darkness" starts off with a clatter of clanging guitar chords and drums before morphing into something quite heavily reminiscent of the Motorik pulse of Neu!, albeit far more outwardly sinister and disturbed, with the incomparable, oft-unintelligible mumbling of David Thomas lending just one of many idiosyncratic touches that remained obtuse and entirely their own in the years that followed. "30 Seconds Over Tokyo" is even more striking, with its Black Sabbath-esque chromatic riff, explosions of noise both from the guitars and Allen Ravenstine\'s EML synthesizer, and a resolutely bizarre rhythmic shift in the middle from a creepy-crawling, fractured waltz to some kind of country/polka mental breakdown. It\'s not often you can say that something legitimately sounds like nothing else that had ever previously been recorded, even considering the radically strange sounds of such predecessors as Zappa, Beefheart, The United States of America and the Silver Apples, and this one is of a rare breed in that respect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Final Solution" is much more conventionally structured, and lyrically conventional, a "dumb teen angst song" that is nonetheless augmented by all manner of avant-garde flourishes, thus making for possibly the most obvious example of Ubu\'s self-proclaimed "avant-garage" label. Obviously, despite its controversial title, it has nothing to do with the Holocaust or Nazism, but when British punkers began appropriating the swastika as a form of pure provocation not long after its recording, the band promptly dropped it from their repertoire for a number of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While that three-song salvo is enough of a knockout punch of frightening bliss, the remaining material on this collection is never anything other than a case in point of just that kind of blissful eccentricity, whether it\'s the almost shockingly bright chime of "Heaven" and "Not Happy" or a frighteningly intense live recording of the song "Humor Me", possibly the angriest and most aggressive song of their early days which was written about the premature alcohol-related death of original member Peter Laughner, and later included in a drastically more tame studio version on their 1978 full-length debut &lt;i&gt;The Modern Dance&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Terminal Tower&lt;/i&gt; goes beyond the quality of the best sort of compilation album; as great as many of their studio albums are, especially &lt;i&gt;The Modern Dance &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Dub Housing&lt;/i&gt;, the comp is arguably more consistent from beginning to end than any of them, and as diverse a range of both material and lineup configurations there is in the five-year span covered, it all feels like it\'s supposed to sit where it sits in the sequencing order, like it really is a proper album. It\'s concise, listenable, and there\'s still not much else out there that sounds like the music contained on it.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/pere-ubu-terminal-tower-1985.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyJGjxWESN0/VRhmMgpzuJI/AAAAAAAAAgU/Qf1Ex88TfJU/s72-c/MI0000032900.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-269270848548179886</guid><pubdate>Sun, 29 Mar 2015 04:10:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-28T21:10:14.652-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pavement "Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain" (1994)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ML6gQk9nKYs/VRdxjbWhhpI/AAAAAAAAAgA/B_UjsNto7SI/s1600/220px-Pavement_Crooked_Rain.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ML6gQk9nKYs/VRdxjbWhhpI/AAAAAAAAAgA/B_UjsNto7SI/s1600/220px-Pavement_Crooked_Rain.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And so with their second full-length album, Pavement essentially pulled a Pinocchio by completing the transition from Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg\'s lo-fi recording project into a proper, full-fledged rock band, which was already underway from the recording of &lt;i&gt;Slanted and Enchanted&lt;/i&gt; and subsequent extensive touring. Shortly before recording &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain&lt;/i&gt;, the group jettisoned their 40-year-old ex-hippie drummer Gary Young, who had recorded Malkmus and Kannberg\'s earliest compositions under the Pavement name in his home studio and played a huge role in defining their early reputation as a very erratic, messy live act with his bizarre behavior and drunken performances. His departure seemed to take a lot of their endearing ineptitude with him, but seeing as his replacement Steve West is as fine a drummer they could\'ve hoped for with his steadily building, exciting fills, it\'s hardly a sad loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lineup change is the farthest thing from the only or the most significant thing that\'s different this time around; where &lt;i&gt;Slanted and Enchanted&lt;/i&gt; was a dense, enigmatic affair, brimming with fantastic, oftentimes melodic songs that were nonetheless thoroughly off-kilter and surrounded by all manner of murk, mystique and tape hiss, &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain &lt;/i&gt;embraces a shimmering classic-rock sound that nonetheless retains all of Pavement\'s personality. The noise and the lyrical impenetrability are entirely still here, especially the latter, yet it sounds a million times more accessible than its predecessor, right from the staggeringly gorgeous opener "Silence Kit", and a couple of songs even became moderate alt-rock hits, which of course are "Cut Your Hair" and "Range Life". One is without a doubt their most winsome "pop" moment, only to be rivaled later in the record by the positively glistening "Gold Soundz", while the other one has a then-mildly controversial verse (bagging sardonically on the Smashing Pumpkins and Stone Temple Pilots) that in hindsight seems to spell out the ever-more visible divide between the commercial "alternative rock" that Nirvana had popularized a few years earlier and the still-underground, still violently anti-commercial "indie rock" that was just beginning to define itself apart from mainstream rock of the time in the view of casual observers at least. Released as a single just after Nirvana\'s tragic dissolution and amid a sea of "bubblegrunge" imitators that would only grow in number and cringeworthiness over the latter half of the 90\'s, it captures a very different kind of shared feeling than the one spoken to in "Smells Like Teen Spirit", and in its own way it\'s just as historically important for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more impressive, the already genre-bending Pavement were trying loads of new sounds, such as country-rock ("Range Life", "Stop Breathin\'") and even a bit of jazz ("5-4=Unity"). It\'s a quantum leap forward from its predecessor, never once really sounding like the previous album in the slightest way, shape or form, and at the same time it still sounded like nothing and nobody else under the sun when it was released in early 1994. The genre-busting would come even further to the fore with the wildly eclectic &lt;i&gt;Wowee Zowee&lt;/i&gt; the following year, but it\'s definitely more focused and concentrated on &lt;i&gt;Crooked Rain&lt;/i&gt;, which of course is still rightfully acclaimed as one of the greatest rock albums of the 1990\'s.

As deeply personal as the album is, it hit a raw nerve with a post-counterculture audience at the time of its release, which of course was the height of the early-70\'s singer-songwriter boom, and &lt;i&gt;Blue &lt;/i&gt;would remain the high watermark of the sensitive folksinger pantomime of the era, rivaled only by fellow Canadian Neil Young\'s &lt;i&gt;After the Gold Rush&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike many other hit records of that era, however, Mitchell here expands her musical palette beyond what had been heard on her previous three albums, incorporating more wholly piano-led material than her earlier days, and utilizing her trademark unique guitar style when she does play the guitar. More importantly, the songs are often unconventionally structured and incorporate elements of jazz, paving the way for the weirder, wilder sounds she would dive into later in the decade as scores of soft-rockers heavily influenced by albums like &lt;i&gt;Blue &lt;/i&gt;made a killing on the charts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its reputation lies on it being the quintessential "confessional" singer-songwriter album, an idea Mitchell has often derided over the years, it\'s not quite a concept album about the aforementioned breakup, or about her newfound relationship with James Taylor, nor is it an entirely down album by any stretch of the imagination; "California", a worthy successor to "Woodstock", is proof positive of that. But the key to what makes &lt;i&gt;Blue &lt;/i&gt;so powerful is its intimacy and its honesty, which was so stark and revealing by the ears of one Kris Kristofferson that when Mitchell played him the record for the first time, the country music legend supposedly remarked, "Joni! Keep something of yourself!"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\'s no pretension or messing around in the opening "All I Want", or in the gorgeous love song that follows, "My Old Man". The older song "Little Green" was long thought to be an exception to the rule, once described as "impenetrable", before it came to light in the 1990s that it had been written (along with a number of Mitchell\'s other songs) about a daughter she\'d had to give up for adoption long before she became famous, who she only met for the first time after her daughter had passed her 30th birthday. "Carey" chronicles her self-imposed exile in a remote cave on the Greek island Crete, and the hauntingly spare title track was written for and about Taylor, referencing his own heroin addiction and the horse-addled collapse of the hippie counterculture at the same time. Much speculation went on about what other singer-songwriters were being referenced in her lyrics on the album, with rumors floating around about Jackson Browne and Leonard Cohen along with the confirmed Nash and Taylor, ultimately leading none other than Rolling Stone magazine to idiotically dub her "Old Lady of the Year" and make a satirical diagram of her supposed affairs and conquests, as if she was only important by way of the far more talented men she had been romantically linked to. Doubtlessly, this slut-shaming did much to confirm the waning counterculture\'s hypocrisy and inevitably flawed ideals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four decades later, &lt;i&gt;Blue &lt;/i&gt;is not just a classic album but a classic archetype, one that would inform the work of commercially successful female singer-songwriters long after the likes of Mitchell, Taylor and Stephen Stills had vanished from chart prominence, not to mention artists like Elliott Smith, Cat Power, PJ Harvey, Nick Cave and Red House Painters. It\'s the type of album an artist typically makes once and only once, and stands apart from the rest of their work as its own unique entity.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/joni-mitchell-blue-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xqjl-E86ZJI/VRVqIvG40KI/AAAAAAAAAfs/1Vj7Xsatb-M/s72-c/Bluealbumcover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3192925130890111298</guid><pubdate>Fri, 27 Mar 2015 04:08:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-26T21:08:31.606-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Strokes "Is This It" (2001)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LbWA3N2o4Gc/VRTOzWvqmkI/AAAAAAAAAfY/CavZizHnsbA/s1600/220px-The_Strokes_-_Is_This_It_cover.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LbWA3N2o4Gc/VRTOzWvqmkI/AAAAAAAAAfY/CavZizHnsbA/s1600/220px-The_Strokes_-_Is_This_It_cover.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Arriving just when critics widely considered guitar bands a thing of the past, The Strokes\' positively infectious &lt;i&gt;Is This It&lt;/i&gt; breathed new life into the sounds of The Stooges, Television and (most prominently) The Velvet Underground, not to mention scores of other artists the young group weren\'t around to see in the 70\'s. One of the things that makes it such an exceptional, astounding record is that they never succumb to any urge to cop directly from any one of their inspirations, even as "New York City Cops", which was pulled from US editions of the album in light of the September 11 terrorist attacks which occurred two weeks before the album\'s American release date, cribs from Iggy Pop\'s "Lust for Life" and Julian Casablancas\' vocals consistently recall those of Lou Reed (as heard on The Velvets\' classic swan song &lt;i&gt;Loaded&lt;/i&gt;). In a time when 50-75 minute CDs had largely become the norm, at least in terms of mainstream pop/rock, The Strokes kept their first full-length (and their second release in total after the &lt;i&gt;Modern Age&lt;/i&gt; EP) down to a slender 36 minutes, with virtually no space between each song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And each song is fantastic. It starts off with the brief title track, which beautifully spells out the album title\'s brilliant invocation of youthful dissatisfaction. The entire album effortlessly captures that boundless energy and enthusiasm that comes with a lot of classic rock debut albums and usually is never captured in quite the same way on subsequent records; some examples that come most immediately to mind include Supergrass\' &lt;i&gt;I Should Coco&lt;/i&gt;, the original UK version of &lt;i&gt;The Clash&lt;/i&gt;, The Replacements\' &lt;i&gt;Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash&lt;/i&gt; and even The Beatles\' &lt;i&gt;Please Please Me&lt;/i&gt;. There\'s no real studio chicanery to be found here, no frills and absolutely no bullshit, nothing to stand in the way of the pure malevolent joy that resonates through every second of music of the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cocky sneer of Casablancas, coupled with the bright but tough melodies and hooks, conjures up an image of your late teens/early twenties no matter how young or old you actually are, and even if you\'re listening to it for the first time in years, your brain acts like it never stopped hearing the record when the melodies kick in. Songs like "The Modern Age", "Last Nite", "Someday" and "Hard to Explain" are among the greatest rock songs to be recorded since the dawn of the new millenium, and jump out of car radios just like the best of the old AM pop radio hits of the pre-psychedelic 60\'s, although the last of the foursome perfectly incorporates a compressed drum track that sounds like mechanical percussion and (along with "Soma") makes for a sublime post-modern touch to their resolutely traditional, minimalist garage rock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s not tied to the baggage of all the British music press hype that preceded its release. It\'s not tied to any specific sound of the past, present or future. And even though The Strokes were an unapologetically stylish, well-dressed little group, they were no shallow product of a designer\'s imagination, not with music this great. Of all the albums anyone ever called timeless, &lt;i&gt;Is This It&lt;/i&gt; is one of the truest and most deserving, and it\'s one of very few albums you can say that about to be released in the 2000s.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/the-strokes-is-this-it-2001.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LbWA3N2o4Gc/VRTOzWvqmkI/AAAAAAAAAfY/CavZizHnsbA/s72-c/220px-The_Strokes_-_Is_This_It_cover.png" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1236580468504926146</guid><pubdate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 07:36:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-22T00:36:47.326-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Nirvana "MTV Unplugged in New York" (1994)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4IhbqhllJH4/VQ5jzihEnTI/AAAAAAAAAfA/rcMu-xp2vJY/s1600/Nirvana_mtv_unplugged_in_new_york.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4IhbqhllJH4/VQ5jzihEnTI/AAAAAAAAAfA/rcMu-xp2vJY/s1600/Nirvana_mtv_unplugged_in_new_york.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;More often than not, albums culled from MTV\'s on-and-off, long-running Unplugged series serve as little more than throwaway cash-grab items that don\'t stand up apart from the TV special, episodes of which aren\'t always terribly spectacular themselves. Nirvana\'s legendary performance, taped on November 18, 1993 and aired the following month, wasn\'t your average Unplugged set to begin with; much to the costernation of MTV executives, the group played just one bona-fide hit ("Come as You Are") and ran through no less than six rather obscure cover songs from The Vaselines, Leadbelly, David Bowie and the Meat Puppets. Due to Kurt Cobain\'s drug withdrawal and the resultant moody behavior in the days leading up to the taping, which included an instance in which Cobain refused to perform at one point just one day prior to the 18th, the people setting up the engagement basically expected it to be a disaster, if it even ended up happening as scheduled. Of course, the show did go on, and the result was one of the greatest live concerts ever broadcast on television.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They start off with a breezy run-through of the pre-fame gem "About a Girl", from 1989\'s &lt;i&gt;Bleach&lt;/i&gt;, and a positively haunting "Come as You Are", and then comes a performance unlike any the group had ever given or ever would again in what little time they would exist afterward; their take on The Vaselines\' "Jesus Doesn\'t Want Me for a Sunbeam", with bassist Krist Novoselic switching to an accordion, is one of the most gorgeous and unconventional moments of their career, and in light of Cobain\'s suicide just four months later, its hymnal feel made it even more sadly beautiful. As fantastic as it is, the chilling reading of Bowie\'s "The Man Who Sold the World" one-ups it with Cobain\'s droning, otherworldly guitar solo. Then a still-grumpy Cobain tells the rest of the band he\'s going to do the next one by himself, giving an anguished, extraordinary "Pennyroyal Tea". At its end, the ever-reliable drummer Grohl tells Kurt, "That was great!" only for Kurt to immediately snap back with an emotionless "shut up". Between-song bits like this are just as important to the album as the performances, recreating the tension surrounding its preparation and reflecting back into the music\'s somber intensity, along with the stage\'s prescient decor: with stargazer lillies, black candles and a crystal chandelier, it was nothing short of a funeral for a still-living man who nonetheless felt an internal death that was already apparent to his closest friends in the months before his actual death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deep cuts like "Dumb" and "Polly", which were already among the group\'s more subdued numbers in their studio incarnations, are perfectly complemented by the almost unnervingly intimate setting. After two more less-than-remarkable deep cuts ("On a Plain" and "Something in the Way"), Curt and Cris Kirkwood of the Meat Puppets come onstage with Nirvana, already augmented beyond the standard three piece with touring guitarist Pat Smear and cellist Lori Goldston, to play their own songs "Plateau", "Oh, Me" and "Lake of Fire". The three-song detour makes for a relaxed change of pace from the melancholy that hangs over the rest of the concert, but after it ends, the band finish it all off with an even sadder "All Apologies" than the studio recording and the old folk-blues "Where Did You Sleep Last Night?" (otherwise known as "In the Pines"), the latter learned via Kurt\'s beloved Leadbelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the annals of popular music, there are few climaxes to an album or concert performance that have ever been as overwhelmingly powerful as the one to their version of "Where Did You Sleep"; as Kurt\'s vocal has been steadily building in intensity throughout the song, he\'s finally going to "shiver the whole night through", and when he sings "shiver", he howls it with a still-startling ferocity to the point where his voice goes up an octave and cracks like he\'s about to lose it. Remarkably, he doesn\'t, and finishes the song. It\'s no wonder that many people hear his battered, heavy heart giving out right there onstage at this exact moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As emotionally draining and difficult as it can be to listen to all the way through, &lt;i&gt;MTV Unplugged in New York&lt;/i&gt; is one of the most unlikely great live rock albums of all time; where other celebrated live rock albums are almost always all about the energy and volume of the music captured on disc, this one stands out for instead being a deceptively pretty, harrowing document of the misery of a deeply troubled and very talented young man who would meet a horribly tragic demise just months after it was recorded. Of all the other troubled rock &amp;amp; rollers of yore who died young, Kurt Cobain might be the only one to have had his spiraling final path into the abyss captured so vividly on film and in audio like this, and it still pops.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/nirvana-mtv-unplugged-in-new-york-1994.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4IhbqhllJH4/VQ5jzihEnTI/AAAAAAAAAfA/rcMu-xp2vJY/s72-c/Nirvana_mtv_unplugged_in_new_york.png" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-351882387494919832</guid><pubdate>Sun, 22 Mar 2015 00:45:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-21T17:45:41.118-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Elliott Smith "Elliott Smith" (1995)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B45lY-7yA58/VQ4KH_uyp-I/AAAAAAAAAew/RdIvOWG8NxQ/s1600/220px-Elliott_Smith_(album).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B45lY-7yA58/VQ4KH_uyp-I/AAAAAAAAAew/RdIvOWG8NxQ/s1600/220px-Elliott_Smith_(album).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;On his first solo album, the half-formed, poorly recorded &lt;i&gt;Roman Candle&lt;/i&gt;, Elliott Smith didn\'t quite hit the ground running, but it was good enough to attract attention from Slim Moon\'s Kill Rock Stars label, who signed him promptly and released his eponymous second album in mid-1995. One suspects that he wasn\'t terribly confident in his abilities as a solo performer while still performing in the post-hardcore band Heatmiser, but with the attention garnered from &lt;i&gt;Roman Candle &lt;/i&gt;quickly eclipsing that band, &lt;i&gt;Elliott Smith &lt;/i&gt;shows off a singer and songwriter who\'s forgotten about whatever doubts he may have once had and comes out with a selection of infinitely superior songs to the ones on the debut album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening "Needle in the Hay" would one day become perhaps Smith\'s signature song, a harrowing yet opaque account of debilitating chemical dependency that sets the tone for what can in many ways be considered a concept album about addiction, although Smith always claimed he used drug addiction as a metaphor for other forms of dependency. And indeed, all the songs have enough light and shade to give rise to your own personal interpretation of their lyrics, whatever they seem to mean to you or anyone else in particular. There are still songs like "The White Lady Loves You More" and the magnificent "St. Ides Heaven" which are quite obviously about drug addiction and alcoholism, respectively, and unfortunately Smith\'s own personal problems that would spin out of control towards the end of his life gave the assumption that all the songs were about drugs a heavy likelihood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as important as the great songs is how Smith progressed musically from his first recordings, still playing nearly all the instruments himself, but incorporating ones like harmonica ("Alphabet Town") that he hadn\'t used before and using light trap drums on more of the tracks, not to mention being joined by Heatmiser bandmate Neil Gust playing electric guitar on "Single File" and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates providing gorgeous harmony vocals on "St. Ides Heaven". These additions don\'t take anything away from the still strictly lo-fi presentation and the almost uncomfortable intimacy in his performances, and the approach would only be expanded on even further with the even better 1997 follow-up &lt;i&gt;Either/Or&lt;/i&gt; before Smith left Kill Rock Stars for the major label DreamWorks on the strength of his contributions to the "Good Will Hunting" soundtrack.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/elliott-smith-elliott-smith-1995.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B45lY-7yA58/VQ4KH_uyp-I/AAAAAAAAAew/RdIvOWG8NxQ/s72-c/220px-Elliott_Smith_(album).jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8076582325361598268</guid><pubdate>Sat, 21 Mar 2015 18:48:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-21T11:48:12.407-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Can "Future Days" (1973)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KeID3BRmD-c/VQ2y6xjuitI/AAAAAAAAAec/qOF0BgB4j2I/s1600/220px-Can_-_Future_Days.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KeID3BRmD-c/VQ2y6xjuitI/AAAAAAAAAec/qOF0BgB4j2I/s1600/220px-Can_-_Future_Days.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Just as they\'d shifted from the Velvet Underground-informed, chugging rock of their earliest days to the uncompromising avant-garde experimentalism of &lt;i&gt;Tago Mago &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Ege Bamyasi&lt;/i&gt;, Can took another leap of faith into a bold new direction with 1973\'s &lt;i&gt;Future Days&lt;/i&gt;. The Karlheinz Stockhausen-influenced electronic elements that had surfaced in its two predecessors came into full shape here, with its downright lush, beautiful title track standing in marked contrast with the previous album\'s frantic opener "Pinch". While the organic jamming and interaction between musicians has gone nowhere, the ever-pulsating rhythms of Jaki Leibezeit are now fully complemented with synthesizers and full-blown soundscapes, a full-bodied, gorgeous sound that was genuinely like nothing else that had come before it and would reverberate through electronic and indie music for decades to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Damo Suzuki\'s vocals, which would depart from the group after the album\'s completion when Suzuki married his girlfriend, quit music and became a Jehovah\'s Witness, are softer and sweeter than they had ever been, with none of the caustic, bracing ranting or babbling that occasionally surfaced in previous recordings. With his singing so often buried by the layers of sound, &lt;i&gt;Future Days &lt;/i&gt;would rightly become regarded as a landmark in the evolution of ambient electronica, which Brian Eno would build on over the next several years with renowned records like &lt;i&gt;Another Green World&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Discreet Music &lt;/i&gt;before fully codifying and defining it as a genre with 1978\'s &lt;i&gt;Music for Airports&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But &lt;i&gt;Future Days &lt;/i&gt;is much too lively and detailed to be mere background music by any stretch of the imagination, especially when the majestic, soothing tapestry of sound is briefly broken by the irresistible three-minute pop single "Moonshake", which would be the group\'s most accessible song until their 1976 fluke British hit "I Want More", which came long after Can\'s most acclaimed and influential works with Suzuki. The album culminates with the complex, sprawling 20-minute "Bel Air", a meticulous compilation of three different performances that were painstakingly edited together in a process that supposedly brought forth inter-member debates about whether or not the final product sounded "too symphonic", i.e. too much like classical-rock dinosaurs that the group detested. Of course, it\'s nothing at all like the idiotic musical masturbation of Emerson, Lake &amp;amp; Palmer, and it makes for the absolute perfect culmination of both the album and Can\'s most artistically successful period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can\'s renaissance trilogy came to an end with an album that was just as strong as the first two, which is something even David Bowie couldn\'t manage to do with his own Krautrock-influenced "Berlin Trilogy" at the end of the 70\'s. Indeed, &lt;i&gt;Future Days &lt;/i&gt;might just be the peak of the loose "Krautrock" genre, summing up its post-psychedelic trappings and pointing the way towards the wholly electronic sounds of Kraftwerk. It\'s simply one of the greatest and most influential albums of the 1970\'s, one of those classic records that took decades to reveal its enormous sway over future music and might still be doing so.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/can-future-days-1973.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KeID3BRmD-c/VQ2y6xjuitI/AAAAAAAAAec/qOF0BgB4j2I/s72-c/220px-Can_-_Future_Days.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3470280632000347306</guid><pubdate>Sat, 21 Mar 2015 17:38:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-21T10:38:38.311-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Can "Ege Bamyasi" (1972)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cYhkWwT13ak/VQ2ia5pFFgI/AAAAAAAAAeM/DvUwcGIeRak/s1600/220px-Egebamyasialbumcover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cYhkWwT13ak/VQ2ia5pFFgI/AAAAAAAAAeM/DvUwcGIeRak/s1600/220px-Egebamyasialbumcover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After the barrier-smashing sonic exploration of 1971\'s &lt;i&gt;Tago Mago&lt;/i&gt;, Can pared that album\'s sound and sprawl way back on 1972\'s &lt;i&gt;Ege Bamyasi&lt;/i&gt;, a much more relaxed, approachable record that\'s much more grounded in organic jazz and funk-based sounds while at the same time incorporating more innovative electronic elements that would come even further to the fore with the pioneering ambient sound of the ensuing &lt;i&gt;Future Days&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opening nine-minute "Pinch" rides on a much more tense, coiled groove than any of &lt;i&gt;Tago Mago&lt;/i&gt;\'s lumbering stomps, closely recalling the hectic Afrobeat of Fela Kuti with its uptempo pacing and busy percussion. "Sing Swan Song" and "One More Night" are intrinsically left-of-center, but much more down to earth than the previous record\'s cosmic otherworldliness, which permeated even its most approachable moments. Not to say that Can were ever anything less than from another planet than the rest of the music world, but I digress. With "Vitamin C", the group come closer to conventional song structure than they had been since 1969\'s hard-rocking &lt;i&gt;Monster Movie&lt;/i&gt;; Damo Suzuki\'s vocals are incomprehensible as ever in its verses, but the chorus (yes, there actually is one) is an absolute stunner, with Suzuki crying out "Hey you! You\'re losing your vitamin C!"&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;with pure anguish and intensity, all on top of a danceable slice of dark funk that the group would only seldom approach thereafter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s followed quite ironically by the wildly diffuse ten-and-a-half minute "Soup", the record\'s most overtly avant-garde moment, and then finishes up with two more concise numbers, "I\'m So Green" and "Spoon". The latter had been released as a stand-alone single in Germany months before the album\'s recording got underway, and it managed to make Can moderately famous in their home country when it was used as the theme music for a popular crime drama, and the single even made the German Top 10 chart, which apparently helped Can to afford to use a better recording studio than in previous sessions when they did go in to record the rest of &lt;i&gt;Ege Bamyasi&lt;/i&gt;. A quarter century later, it also gave a heavily acclaimed American indie rock group its name, but that\'s another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it has an entirely different sound and feel than its predecessor, while managing to retain all their avant-garde experimental leanings, &lt;i&gt;Ege Bamyasi &lt;/i&gt;is easily the equal of its predecessor, and it\'s no wonder that some folks even think that it\'s the superior album.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/can-ege-bamyasi-1972.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cYhkWwT13ak/VQ2ia5pFFgI/AAAAAAAAAeM/DvUwcGIeRak/s72-c/220px-Egebamyasialbumcover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7073945777492678623</guid><pubdate>Sat, 21 Mar 2015 16:20:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-21T09:20:21.783-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Can "Tago Mago" (1971)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fyc-MpppW4A/VQ2Pv89zJDI/AAAAAAAAAd8/knrfjhOz18E/s1600/220px-Can_-_Tago_Mago.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fyc-MpppW4A/VQ2Pv89zJDI/AAAAAAAAAd8/knrfjhOz18E/s1600/220px-Can_-_Tago_Mago.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Taking their cue from the hypnotic 20-minute opus "Yoo Doo Right", which closed out their 1969 debut album &lt;i&gt;Monster Movie&lt;/i&gt;, Can moved sonically from a driving, menacing Velvet Underground and garage rock-influenced pulse into uncharted realms of atonal experimentation and monolithic, rambling grooves, a shift helped in no small part by the replacement of American vocalist Malcolm Mooney with the mysterious Japanese drifter Damo Suzuki. Mooney was a pretty good fit for the more raucous rock of their earlier days, but Suzuki, with his chanting words that drifted between the English and Japanese languages and included phrases that he\'d simply come up with himself, was key to the even more radical and innovative music Can would create on 1971\'s &lt;i&gt;Tago Mago&lt;/i&gt;. As solid as its predecessor was, not to mention more accessible, it was with this double-LP that Can largely solidified their legacy as one of the most influential avant-garde rock bands of all time, an album that would resonate with future generations of adventuresome post-punk and indie rock acts and will most definitely continue to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part of the reason it has such a singular legacy as an album is that it would remain Can\'s most extreme record, a lengthy, challenging work that the group wisely felt the need to pare down for its equally strong, somewhat more approachable single-LP follow-up &lt;i&gt;Ege Bamyasi&lt;/i&gt;. Where previous double-albums up to 1971 had been known for their stylistic diversity (&lt;i&gt;The White Album&lt;/i&gt;) or their epic sprawl (&lt;i&gt;Electric Ladyland&lt;/i&gt;), this one is known for testing listeners\' patience. It opens with the ominous, melancholy "Paperhouse", which starts off as a mournful dirge and turns into a rumbling stomp midway through, and the two following numbers ("Mushroom" and "Oh Yeah") may turn rock music upside down and inside out with bizarre song structures and electronic flourishes of a unique sort that had never before been heard in "rock music", but they\'re relatively concise and recognizable as tunes. The nearly 20-minute "Halleluhwah", the album\'s longest track, starts right off with a monster avant-funk groove and keeps moving all throughout with drummer Jaki Leibezeit\'s legendarily machine-like beatkeeping and Holger Czukay\'s deathless bass line, but the immediately following "Aumgn" runs up to nearly the exact same length and is by contrast a purposefully opaque flow of ambient sound that eventually builds up to a fiery climax.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beginning the album\'s second half, i.e. the beginning of record two on vinyl,"Aumgn" signals the point where the musicians abandon anything resembling conventional structure, continuing to go thrillingly off the rails with the wild sound collage "Peking O" before returning to the chiming sound of the opening "Paperhouse" with the closing "Bring Me Coffee or Tea". It\'s not only an excellent, uncompromising collection of songs and sounds, but it\'s also a perfectly sequenced record to boot with the way it ebbs and flows. It\'s a cliche to say it, but it really does make for an adventure for first-time listeners, a sense that only increases as you discover things you hadn\'t noticed before with each subsequent listen.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/can-tago-mago-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fyc-MpppW4A/VQ2Pv89zJDI/AAAAAAAAAd8/knrfjhOz18E/s72-c/220px-Can_-_Tago_Mago.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5123904606794728986</guid><pubdate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 05:13:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-14T22:13:02.890-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Pretenders "Pretenders II" (1981)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NqaX8Bksgdo/VQUUdxrbXgI/AAAAAAAAAdo/1bCPXeDDzuo/s1600/Pretenders_II_(The_Pretenders_album_-_cover_art).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NqaX8Bksgdo/VQUUdxrbXgI/AAAAAAAAAdo/1bCPXeDDzuo/s1600/Pretenders_II_(The_Pretenders_album_-_cover_art).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The first Pretenders album ranks as unquestionably one of the finest rock debut albums of all time, an influential and unique record that inevitably put pressure on the group when it came time to record its follow-up, which was put together not long after the success of its predecessor and wound up falling short of expectations set by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pretenders II &lt;/i&gt;will always be remembered as a textbook example of a sophomore album that ends up a disappointment in the wake of an audacious debut, to be filed in the same category as everything from Cheap Trick\'s &lt;i&gt;In Color,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;to the Dead Boys\' &lt;i&gt;We Have Come for Your Children,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;to&amp;nbsp;The Smiths\' &lt;i&gt;Meat is Murder, &lt;/i&gt;and beyond. While the singles and deep cuts alike on the first Pretenders album were equally inspired and thrilling, ranging from the wildly unconventional "Tattooed Love Boys" and the punky "Precious" to the sighing melodies of "Kid", "Brass in Pocket" and "Lovers of Today", their second LP gets bogged down in one too many rather uninspired riffs and some surprisingly weak songwriting from Chrissie Hynde.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hynde isn\'t as consistent as a singer or writer, and perhaps even more disappointingly, lead guitarist James Honeyman-Scott doesn\'t have as many surprises up his sleeve as he had on earlier tracks. The album does contain a few of the very best Pretenders songs, like the tough "Message of Love" and the shimmering "Talk of the Town", not to mention a top version of The Kinks\' relatively obscure "I Go to Sleep". Unfortunately, the majority of the other cuts are comparatively unmemorable efforts, like the opening "The Adultress" and "Bad Boys Get Spanked", a kinkier but considerably&amp;nbsp;less bracing sequel to "Tattooed Love Boys". By album\'s end, it\'s only gotten progressively less engaging with each of its last few numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a number of groups that have historically been afflicted with this sophomore album slump, the slump often became the impetus for a knockout punch of a third album, and indeed, the Pretenders&amp;nbsp;would triumph with the heavily autobiographical &lt;i&gt;Learning to Crawl &lt;/i&gt;in 1984, but only after the tragic and sudden deaths of James Honeyman-Scott and bassist Pete Farndon in the intermediary three years. &lt;i&gt;Pretenders II &lt;/i&gt;would consequently turn out to be the original group\'s last gasp, which gives an already disheartening LP a sense of sadness that in its&amp;nbsp;most obvious sense would be chronicled by Hynde in her later songs, particularly on &lt;i&gt;Learning to Crawl, &lt;/i&gt;but also in a sense that has only become more obvious in the decades since, seeing as the group would never again be as exceptional as it had been with Scott and Farndon.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/pretenders-pretenders-ii-1981.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-NqaX8Bksgdo/VQUUdxrbXgI/AAAAAAAAAdo/1bCPXeDDzuo/s72-c/Pretenders_II_(The_Pretenders_album_-_cover_art).jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6438263500987219882</guid><pubdate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 05:08:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-14T22:08:09.010-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Radiohead "The Bends" (1995)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iD74-KerYvA/VQUIhMMI5nI/AAAAAAAAAdY/a86JwocrPS0/s1600/220px-Radiohead.bends.albumart.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iD74-KerYvA/VQUIhMMI5nI/AAAAAAAAAdY/a86JwocrPS0/s1600/220px-Radiohead.bends.albumart.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When Radiohead first appeared in 1993 with the smash-hit "Creep", which essentially sounded like a meeting between the loud-quiet dynamics of Nirvana and the soaring, angst-ridden anthems of early Pearl Jam, most critics and observers smelled a carpetbagging rat on the same level as Stone Temple Pilots or (although they came a bit later) fellow Britishers Bush, who would surely disappear just as soon as they\'d hit it big and/or the Seattle grunge hype blew away with the next wind. Their uneven debut album &lt;i&gt;Pablo Honey&lt;/i&gt; didn\'t help matters, and so the expectations for their second album were understandably quite low, especially given that by the time they got around to the beginning of their sessions in late \'94 the "grunge boom" was indeed considered close to dead or at least officially irrelevant in the wake of Kurt Cobain\'s suicide and Pearl Jam\'s public retreat from stardom. Nobody had a clue that Radiohead were about to wave a big ol\' middle finger in the faces of all the naysayers and make a remarkable artistic leap forward in the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1995\'s &lt;i&gt;The Bends &lt;/i&gt;is nearly devoid of whatever derivative parts of American alt-rock may have been floating about on its predecessor, although "Just" in particular and even the breakthrough hit ballad "Fake Plastic Trees" have a similar loud-quiet cathartic structure. For one thing, it\'s a much more sonically expansive record than any American "grunge" band would make, displaying the previously unheard influence of Queen\'s theatrical rock and the progressive rock of Pink Floyd. What really set them apart this time out is how well Thom Yorke established his distinctive, strangled falsetto, which he could of course easily morph into a snarl at a moment\'s notice. Like many bands who seem to suddenly find their voice from one album to the next, and given what we know about the band now, it sounds like their real debut album, while its predecessor has been long-since forgotten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While "High and Dry", coupled with Oasis\' "Wonderwall", would practically make up the sonic blueprint for several regrettable post-Britpop bands that made it big in the early oughts (Coldplay and Travis are the first that come to mind), most of the album finds the group tentatively beginning to explore the themes of consumerism, alienation and isolation that would pervade its critically worshiped follow-up &lt;i&gt;OK Computer&lt;/i&gt;. On its own, however, aside from the part it now seems to play in Radiohead\'s chronological history, what makes &lt;i&gt;The Bends &lt;/i&gt;a classic is how the band breathes new life into the kind of meeting between arena-rock anthems, thoughtful lyricism and post-punk sensibilities that U2 had specialized in during the 1980\'s, and how they seamlessly marry loud rock with their increasingly abstract lyrics in a thrilling way that they would never quite repeat again. In a discography with later albums whose innovation in both sonics and marketing can easily overshadow everything else Radiohead might\'ve done before they were an almost tiresomely lauded institution of endless analytical fodder, &lt;i&gt;The Bends &lt;/i&gt;has held up surprisingly well, and still stands as one of the best and most influential rock albums of the 90\'s.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/radiohead-bends-1995.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-iD74-KerYvA/VQUIhMMI5nI/AAAAAAAAAdY/a86JwocrPS0/s72-c/220px-Radiohead.bends.albumart.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-79437808850504556</guid><pubdate>Sun, 15 Mar 2015 04:15:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-14T21:15:35.640-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Elliott Smith "Either/Or" (1997)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v4c3I6nFMrQ/VQT7HTMGkTI/AAAAAAAAAdI/stKLQ4qJ-PA/s1600/MI0000128813.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v4c3I6nFMrQ/VQT7HTMGkTI/AAAAAAAAAdI/stKLQ4qJ-PA/s1600/MI0000128813.jpg" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Elliott Smith only wound up completing five solo albums in his venerable yet tragically shortened time as one of the very best and most distinctive singer/songwriters on the planet. As the third one, 1997\'s &lt;i&gt;Either/Or &lt;/i&gt;is a dead-center middle ground with hindsight on its side between the strictly sparse, almost unnervingly intimate solo performances that dominated his first two albums (1994\'s &lt;i&gt;Roman Candle &lt;/i&gt;and \'95\'s self-titled sophomore effort) and the lush pop songcraft of the ensuing &lt;i&gt;XO &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Figure 8&lt;/i&gt;. To take a detour for a minute, there\'s more recently an added level of observation that can be applied to Smith\'s career after &lt;i&gt;Either/Or &lt;/i&gt;and why those latter two records were much more elaborately produced; they would be released by the major DreamWorks Records after Smith became a fluke fringe pop-star thanks to the inclusion of the song "Miss Misery" along with two songs from this album on the soundtrack to the acclaimed film "Good Will Hunting", which starred the recently deceased Robin Williams, who in a stroke of tragic irony seems to have met a demise unfortunately similar to how Elliott Smith most likely (and quite unexpectedly) ended his own life in 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, it\'s no wonder that many people consider &lt;i&gt;Either/Or &lt;/i&gt;to be Smith\'s best album. It\'s perhaps the most cohesive collection of songs he\'d ever assemble, where he\'s still playing all the instruments himself as in the previous two albums, but he\'s playing more of them, and more often, resulting in the soaring (yet still rather understated) power-pop of "Ballad of Big Nothing" and just the right amount of creamy double-tracking applied to that whispery, thin voice of his. Regardless of the slightly busier arrangements, it\'s still as intimate and introspective as could be, still angst-ridden and given over to accounts of alcoholic shiftlessness ("Between the Bars", "2:45 AM") and self-examination ("Pictures of Me") as always. One other shift that\'s noticeable, though, is that Elliott isn\'t quite as despairing as he had been particularly on the album\'s immediate predecessor, resulting in a somewhat more diverse range of subject matter that made for a smart change of pace, which apparently was a deliberate move on Smith\'s part to avoid being pigeonholed as the perennial depressive loner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For example, on "Angeles" (one of the selections cherry-picked for the "Good Will Hunting" soundtrack), he\'s tearing apart the cynical celebrity culture of the titular city with all the vitriol of Dylan\'s "Like a Rolling Stone" or "Ballad of a Thin Man", albeit in the same wispy voice that always made for a startling contrast with any number of his other angrier lyrics. While "Pictures of Me" is as much about himself as anyone else, its chorus ("So sick and tired of all these pictures of me") is a direct slam on those who tried (and would continue to try) to assume they knew everything about him. And with the other song used for that soundtrack, the closing "Say Yes", he even has a bona-fide love song, which he himself admitted he normally never did. It\'s probably the most unabashedly bright and optimistic song he would ever write, which in an odd sort of twist when listening to it makes you feel all the more sorry for him that he didn\'t feel or at least seem this happy most of the time in his music. It\'s deservedly one of his best-known songs, and a fine way to cap off one of the finest albums of its time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/elliott-smith-eitheror-1997.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-v4c3I6nFMrQ/VQT7HTMGkTI/AAAAAAAAAdI/stKLQ4qJ-PA/s72-c/MI0000128813.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5282431341195923607</guid><pubdate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:36:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-13T10:36:23.077-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bad Brains "I Against I" (1986)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HSKri8IeuGI/VQMUUWvenHI/AAAAAAAAAc0/yR7bqR3DDXQ/s1600/220px-BadBrainsIAgainstI.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HSKri8IeuGI/VQMUUWvenHI/AAAAAAAAAc0/yR7bqR3DDXQ/s1600/220px-BadBrainsIAgainstI.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After a three-year hiatus, the group that did more to pioneer hyper-fast hardcore punk in America than anyone else returned with a funk-metal masterpiece that comes closer than any of their other albums to equaling their classic 1982 debut album. While that initially cassette-only ROIR full-length was arguably the definitive hardcore album, packing heap-tons of stone-cold classic thrashers, &lt;i&gt;I Against I&lt;/i&gt; would likewise become a landmark touchstone of the sort of funky punk-metal hybrid that would become huge in the alternative rock world of the 1990\'s. Just ask a member of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime or Jane\'s Addiction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not unlike how an already eclectic Clash had blown open the limitations of their sound with &lt;i&gt;London Calling &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Sandanista!&lt;/i&gt;, here the notoriously versatile Bad Brains expand their musical palette further beyond the hardcore and reggae they had already proven themselves adept at with their debut and 1983\'s Ric Ocasek-produced &lt;i&gt;Rock for Light&lt;/i&gt;, with adroit stop-start rhythms and constantly varying tempos. Not only that, but the maniac frontman H.R. is showing all his vocal cards, from the well-established staccato assault of old to a fervent yelp and a plaintive croon that previously appeared only in a few select tracks from their previous two albums and is much more predominant here. Fans of the Brains\' earlier work may be disappointed by the heavy, mid-tempo rock that dominates the album\'s sound, or the way guitarist Dr. Know is showing off the virtuosic chops that he always had to their full extent for the first time, but it\'s an excellent, natural progression that never sounds as hopelessly hackneyed as many of the other seminal hardcore groups who went for a more metal sound in the mid-80\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of this would mean much without the stellar songs the band brings forth, which represent the pinnacle of their spiritually-fueled vision. After the bombastic intro piece, the Brains surge into the title track with the speed and ferocity of their early days before suddenly switching to a different tempo and then right back to hyper-speed all over again. In the ensuing "House of Suffering", they\'re at the same speed they\'d left off at, but H.R. is now frequently alternating his smooth croon and his ferocious yowl, a contrast that works tremendously in its favor. One of the record\'s most surprising numbers is the sighing, melodic "Secret 77", arriving in the middle of the album and not sounding quite like anything the band had recorded before, while incredibly somehow still managing to sound thoroughly like &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; and no one else. The staggering "Sacred Love" features an excellent vocal from H.R. that was actually recorded over the phone from Lorton Reformatory, where the singer was serving a brief sentence on a pot distribution charge. The resultant deep-sea effect is astonishing and helps make the song one of the album\'s high points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As perhaps should be expected, Bad Brains never surpassed &lt;i&gt;I Against I&lt;/i&gt;, which garnered a considerable wave of music-press attention that wound up with the group signing a deal with major label subsidy Caroline Records. It didn\'t help their momentum one bit when it ended up taking nearly another three years to deliver the record\'s follow-up, 1989\'s controversial &lt;i&gt;Quickness&lt;/i&gt;, which wound up being (at the time) their last album with H.R. and drummer Earl Hudson. Eschewing all the acrimony that has blighted the group\'s on-off career at various times, &lt;i&gt;I Against I&lt;/i&gt; is simply one of the best rock albums of its time, and rivaled only by the ROIR cassette as the Bad Brains\' finest hour.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/bad-brains-i-against-i-1986.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-HSKri8IeuGI/VQMUUWvenHI/AAAAAAAAAc0/yR7bqR3DDXQ/s72-c/220px-BadBrainsIAgainstI.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4618927851154116604</guid><pubdate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 04:49:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-12T21:49:32.423-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Neutral Milk Hotel "In the Aeroplane over the Sea" (1998)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8hBJW_B9kn4/VQJhWfseK4I/AAAAAAAAAcg/Tg7OeJvPDHg/s1600/220px-In_the_aeroplane_over_the_sea_album_cover_copy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8hBJW_B9kn4/VQJhWfseK4I/AAAAAAAAAcg/Tg7OeJvPDHg/s1600/220px-In_the_aeroplane_over_the_sea_album_cover_copy.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Jeff Mangum\'s Neutral Milk Hotel came out of the creatively fertile and massively influential Elephant 6 Collective based in Athens, GA, which peaked in the mid-90\'s but saw its creative peak towards the end of the decade with the landmark &lt;i&gt;In the Aeroplane over the Sea&lt;/i&gt;, a cryptic masterwork which made the recording-project-turned-band into top-gear indie darlings and incurred a wave of heavy press that sent a retiring Mangum into seclusion for well over a decade not long after its release in early 1998. In a lot of ways, the album (along with, for example, Wilco\'s &lt;i&gt;Summerteeth&lt;/i&gt;) set the tone for much of the rustic, traditional folk-based American indie rock which became unprecedentedly popular in the 2000s, which in itself was a quagmire that spawned a number of yawn-worthy, affectation-laden groups with metaphorical, highly elliptical lyrics not entirely unlike Mangum\'s but with far less of his eye-popping, Dylanesque flair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As was and remains a major talking point concerning the record, &lt;i&gt;In the Aeroplane\'s &lt;/i&gt;songs were largely inspired by &lt;i&gt;The Diary of Anne Frank&lt;/i&gt;, a tragic story that tends to lose its weight among young people in America who are still regularly forced to read the book in middle or high school, and thus it confounded many hipster observers in indie rock\'s slowly waning high-irony period when Mangum talked publicly about how much it had affected him emotionally. But aside from explicit references like the distorted stomp of the classic "Holland, 1945", it\'s far from an earnest concept album relating strictly to the life of one particular, famous dead girl; not with the vividly bizarre imagery of "The King of Carrot Flowers", the title track and "Two-Headed Boy". Lines like "And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy\'s shoulder" and "Semen stains the mountaintops" are just as dense and impenetrable as anything Pavement ever wrote, simply delivered vocally with much more sincerity by Mangum than Stephen Malkmus\' quintessential slacker drawl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mangum\'s strained, keening wail is indeed a key and integral component of the music, lending an equal parts sorrowful and redemptive air to the highly varied material at hand that ties everything together so well. It also gives his songs an almost gospel-like fervor and intensity that those aforementioned lesser indie-folk combos often tend to miss, no matter how much the words may frequently ramble on. At a time when the mainstream music world was trumping up the largely atrocious sounds of nu-metal and rap-rock and the indie underground was still reeling from the aftershock of the alt-rock "revolution" of the early 90\'s, &lt;i&gt;In the Aeroplane over the Sea&lt;/i&gt; was an unquestionably timeless, enduring creation that stood outside of any period in time it could\'ve been recorded in, not unlike Neutral Milk Hotel\'s Athens forefathers R.E.M. with the similarly mystifying &lt;i&gt;Murmur &lt;/i&gt;fifteen years earlier. Its huge influence on hordes of currently popular artists is testament enough to it being a substantially influential piece of work, but it\'s remarkable to hear that it hasn\'t dated in the slightest and that it still stands up to being as great as the notoriously fickle, hype-begotten indie rock audience proclaimed it to be upon its release.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/neutral-milk-hotel-in-aeroplane-over.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8hBJW_B9kn4/VQJhWfseK4I/AAAAAAAAAcg/Tg7OeJvPDHg/s72-c/220px-In_the_aeroplane_over_the_sea_album_cover_copy.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8336499368394799063</guid><pubdate>Fri, 13 Mar 2015 03:49:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-12T20:49:49.174-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Throbbing Gristle "20 Jazz Funk Greats" (1979)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAEjbjeO9UM/VQJOKbc03KI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/PUyWKQVfm2c/s1600/220px-20_Jazz_Funk_Greats.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAEjbjeO9UM/VQJOKbc03KI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/PUyWKQVfm2c/s1600/220px-20_Jazz_Funk_Greats.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With their third album, Throbbing Gristle\'s remarkably uncompromising, frighteningly bleak vision reached its full flower while simultaneously expanding the basic industrial music of their previous recordings. For one thing, the group\'s sick sense of humour is on full display with an LP cover that seems to suggest a very lightweight late-60\'s/early 70\'s English pop combo, that is until you find out that the idyllic seaside locale they\'re posing at is actually the most notorious suicide spot in Britain (Beachy Head, which is also the name of one of the album\'s tracks). Its title, of course, quite amusingly suggests yet another type of music that isn\'t actually featured within the grooves of &lt;i&gt;20 Jazz Funk Greats&lt;/i&gt;, although you can easily observe that distorted, mangled fragments of jazz and funk (not to mention disco) do creep into some of the more rhythmic pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never mind what isn\'t featured on the album, because what\'s here is some of the most inventive and disturbing music of its time, or any other period in time really. It runs the gamut from the porno-movie, bassy synth blips of the title track, which recall similar sounds that featured in Eno\'s composition "Over Fire Island" on his 1975 &lt;i&gt;Another Green World&lt;/i&gt; LP, to the one and only mildly accessible song that appears here, "Hot On the Heels of Love", which sounds like nothing short of an avant-garde reinterpretation of Donna Summer\'s disco classic "I Feel Love". That highlight of a track, arriving in the middle of the album, is immediately followed by the deeply disturbing "Persuasion", where Genesis P-Orridge dispassionately moans, "Persuasion, you gotta get some/Look at me I touch your breast/Look at me I touch your knees" over a warbly, distorted two-note bassline that repeats throughout and some frightening found-audio clips of what sounds like either a wildly erotic sexual encounter or, much more likely, a violent rape. When it comes to quite deliberately making one\'s music a very hard pill to swallow by even the standards of "indie" or underground music, Throbbing Gristle &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; have few peers, well over three decades after this album\'s release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from its obvious thematic extremes, which took the seediness of The Velvet Underground to even uglier places, much of the sonic space is justly given over to dark ambient instrumentals that still make for an unsettling soundtrack for Halloween or just about any late, dark winter night. Not a moment too soon, the album finishes with the dissonant "Six Six Sixties", which sounds like a precursor to Sonic Youth\'s music and brings an end to one of the uttermost indelible and influential works of the post-punk era, which would indeed remain Throbbing Gristle\'s pinnacle and their best full-length. Not that they\'d have much time to carry on, mind you; they disbanded just two short years after &lt;i&gt;20 Jazz Funk Greats&lt;/i&gt;, with only one more LP up their sleeves that only saw release a full year after the group called it a day and was essentially a one-off piece of so-called "radio art" that had been commissioned by Italian national radio. The best thing you can say about &lt;i&gt;20 Jazz Funk Greats&lt;/i&gt;, to sum it all up, is ultimately that if it had been their one and only recording, their enormous influence and stature would still be secured in underground and electronic music forevermore. Throbbing Gristle were perhaps the greatest pioneers of what is now known as "industrial" experimental music, in the form that we know it today, and once the cat was out of the bag and they\'d horrified an untold swath of listeners with lyrics and sounds that had never been heard in quite this way before, there was simply no need to drag it out into a "career".</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/throbbing-gristle-20-jazz-funk-greats.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eAEjbjeO9UM/VQJOKbc03KI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/PUyWKQVfm2c/s72-c/220px-20_Jazz_Funk_Greats.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-7756135537283990016</guid><pubdate>Thu, 12 Mar 2015 03:41:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-11T20:41:30.334-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Nine Inch Nails "Pretty Hate Machine" (1989)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5wlT3CIy2-Q/VQD-PLLbLkI/AAAAAAAAAb8/Hl2rb4jsYGw/s1600/220px-Pretty_Hate_Machine_(1989_full_artwork).jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5wlT3CIy2-Q/VQD-PLLbLkI/AAAAAAAAAb8/Hl2rb4jsYGw/s1600/220px-Pretty_Hate_Machine_(1989_full_artwork).jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Like Nirvana\'s &lt;i&gt;Nevermind &lt;/i&gt;and much of the Red Hot Chili Peppers\' entire early oeuvre, &lt;i&gt;Pretty Hate Machine &lt;/i&gt;was, at the time of its release, a groundbreaking, unique object in music that would nonetheless eventually become a blueprint for scores of at least insufferable, often downright godawful copycats; thus it isn\'t viewed with anywhere near as much wide-eyed reverence as, say, &lt;i&gt;Revolver &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Unknown Pleasures, &lt;/i&gt;records which were certainly very influential but could never truly be imitated anyway and which had a much more subtle influence on later musicians. More than anything else, this is because Nine Inch Nails would never make an album that timeless and/or excellent, let alone this debut outing, but the existence of the likes of Linkin Park and Korn can\'t be something Trent Reznor is entirely comfortable with even now. With elements of New Order, Throbbing Gristle, Ministry and Depeche Mode all streamlined into cathartic, rock-based song structures, Reznor brought industrial music as close as it would ever come to bona-fide mainstream success, and like Nirvana\'s breakthrough that was just around the corner with punk and "grunge"-rock, it would in effect be for better and for worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Head Like a Hole" merges Reznor\'s angst-ridden (if rather predictable and ham-handed) lyrics decrying "God Money" with some very inventive music, starting off with distant synthetic percussion that strongly recalls the first few seconds of Blondie\'s "Heart of Glass" and throwing in odd sound effects that wouldn\'t have been out of place on something of Cabaret Voltaire\'s, all while never losing the song\'s headbanging, anthemic quality with its surging chorus. It\'s an impressive feat still, some 25 years after the fact, but the real centerpiece of the album is the restrained gloom of "Something I Can Never Have"; here, Reznor\'s melodramatic howl is taken down to a plaintive near-whisper, and its musical fabric encompasses only a haunting piano figure, drums that appear only sporadically and sound like they were recorded from a block away, and faint synth sounds. It\'s a tremendously ominous performance that in its entire six minutes never reaches the full cathartic bloom of the rest of the album\'s material, and it sets a tone for the darker realms NIN would later delve into headfirst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\'s one thing that keeps &lt;i&gt;Pretty Hate Machine &lt;/i&gt;from being as incredible as it could\'ve been, and that would be the hit-or-miss adolescent poetry that makes up Reznor\'s lyrics. His theatrical angst-ridden arena-sized voice doesn\'t help songs that are often blighted by predictable lines that get repeated in one form or another in different songs, case in point being repetitions of themes like "You took my purity", "You took my soul", et cetera. It\'s the reason that, as surprising and inventive as the album\'s music will always be, it\'s a record that one appreciates much more if they\'re 12 or 13 years old and will never get over breaking up with their first "girlfriend" after "going out" for a whole week (!), and who are just making the terrible discovery that the real world isn\'t Ronald McDonaldland or a fairytale. Thus groups like NIN and Marilyn Manson still often serve as a gateway drug for particularly young listeners to the more cynical misanthropy of Big Black or Ministry, or to other forms of "alternative" music in general. This is definitely what really makes &lt;i&gt;Pretty Hate Machine &lt;/i&gt;such a seminal record that means what it does to so many people, and what makes it important, never minding the horrible sounds Reznor\'s innovations inadvertently begat.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/nine-inch-nails-pretty-hate-machine-1989.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5wlT3CIy2-Q/VQD-PLLbLkI/AAAAAAAAAb8/Hl2rb4jsYGw/s72-c/220px-Pretty_Hate_Machine_(1989_full_artwork).jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6450303793166259287</guid><pubdate>Sat, 07 Mar 2015 17:33:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-03-07T09:33:06.404-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Bratmobile "Pottymouth" (1993)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j0Who88FiWw/VPsvu6loUYI/AAAAAAAAAbY/gDw-K14CDvw/s1600/MI0000708586.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j0Who88FiWw/VPsvu6loUYI/AAAAAAAAAbY/gDw-K14CDvw/s1600/MI0000708586.jpg" height="317" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;And so with their first album Bratmobile came out with one of the seminal records of the original, early-90\'s riot grrrl movement, and one of the best. In contrast to their compatriots in Bikini Kill, Bratmobile had a much more playful, childlike attitude and a sound that encompassed amateurish surf rock and lo-fi twee pop, as opposed to BK\'s grungy, fierce punk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, make no mistake: this is a punk-rock record through and through, and a thoroughly feminist one at that; Allison Wolfe spits out all manner of scathing, profane and, but of course, bratty putdowns against elitist punk scenesters, misogynist men and just about anyone else that she rightly deems worthy of her wrath (key line: "GET OUTTA MY FUCKIN\' LIFE!"), albeit in a voice that often suggests a younger grrrl than the twentysomething she actually was at the time. Song titles like "Fuck Yr. Fans" and "Stab (Me and Fuck the Wounds)" give a pretty good idea of that before you\'ve even heard the music, and when you\'ve heard it you can\'t help but get an adrenaline rush quite unlike most other bands of the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the group\'s primary contribution to pop music history was the empowerment and encouragement they gave young women everywhere who previously would never have thought to make their own music, what really makes &lt;i&gt;Pottymouth &lt;/i&gt;so charming and engaging is how delightfully inept the group were not only by "professional" music standards, but more importantly the standards of the waning hardcore/speed-metal machismo and the metal-influenced, heavy Seattle grunge bands that were exploding commercially at the time of the record\'s release. It\'s their way of telling the underground rock boy\'s club to fuck off and step aside for a minute so they and their fellow grrrls could express themselves in whatever way they felt like, and it still sounds great and continues to inspire female would-be musicians all these years later.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/03/bratmobile-pottymouth-1993.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j0Who88FiWw/VPsvu6loUYI/AAAAAAAAAbY/gDw-K14CDvw/s72-c/MI0000708586.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-345157005803038640</guid><pubdate>Thu, 26 Feb 2015 21:49:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-02-26T13:49:11.084-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Hole "Pretty on the Inside" (1991)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iYPkEpqf1ls/VO-NHaOex-I/AAAAAAAAAaw/WTEwmYrp1LI/s1600/220px-Hole_-_Pretty_on_the_Inside.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iYPkEpqf1ls/VO-NHaOex-I/AAAAAAAAAaw/WTEwmYrp1LI/s1600/220px-Hole_-_Pretty_on_the_Inside.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The incomparable, infamous Courtney Love had spent nearly a decade on the fringes of both the American and British punk/new wave subculture, befriending musicians like Julian Cope and dabbling in acting for the first time with roles in the Alex Cox pictures &lt;i&gt;Sid and Nancy &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Straight to Hell&lt;/i&gt;, and soon became dissatisfied with her life enough to go into seclusion in Alaska while stripping to support herself. At the end of the 80\'s she moved to Los Angeles and formed Hole with the quiet, enigmatic Eric Erlandson, and the group quickly gained a reputation as one of the most dissonant and challenging outfits in the city\'s perpetually evolving rock scene. In 1990 they released their debut single, "Retard Girl", on Sympathy for the Record Industry and then followed it up with "Dicknail" on Sub Pop Records, and both singles generated enough heat that the group were "talked into" a deal with Caroline Records prior to recording their first album with producers Kim Gordon and Don Fleming in early 1991.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As thrilling as the uncompromising, violent &lt;i&gt;Pretty on the Inside &lt;/i&gt;is on a pure gut level, especially songs like the scathing "Teenage Whore" and with its graphic, vividly disturbing lyrical imagery, it shows all too well that their reputation was built as much by Courtney Love\'s "you don\'t love me till you\'ve fucked me", in-your-face persona as their raw, intense sound. In other words, it\'s a very inconsistent, at times even quite incoherent album, much unlike their much more polished, melodic 1994 follow-up &lt;i&gt;Live Through This&lt;/i&gt;. This is perhaps most evident when the rather unfortunately short, thoroughly nasty title track haphazardly morphs into a meandering, sludged-out take on Joni Mitchell\'s "Both Sides Now" (titled "Clouds" here). It\'s an appreciably weird way to end the record, but it doesn\'t succeed as a convincing cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, this doesn\'t seem like much of a downside given that Eric Erlandson has long since confirmed the notion one gets listening to the album that Hole was more interested in making noise than anything else at this stage of their development; prior to the addition of drummer Caroline Rue, who left the group shortly after the album was released, they had played for some time already with no percussion at all, placing them more in line with a no-wave experimental mindset than the "grunge rock" milieu they found themselves inevitably lumped in with upon Courtney\'s marriage to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana, and which they seemed more suited to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pretty on the Inside&lt;/i&gt;, much like Nirvana\'s &lt;i&gt;Bleach&lt;/i&gt; as a matter of fact, is far from an auspicious debut album that hits the ground running, but it accomplished the legitimate goal of introducing the world to rock\'s most controversial and obstinate figure this side of Johnny Rotten or Axl Rose, and remains an influential and combative slab of feminist-minded (not quite riot grrrl, despite many claims to the contrary) noise-rock.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/02/hole-pretty-on-inside-1991.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-iYPkEpqf1ls/VO-NHaOex-I/AAAAAAAAAaw/WTEwmYrp1LI/s72-c/220px-Hole_-_Pretty_on_the_Inside.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4167675444824083738</guid><pubdate>Fri, 20 Feb 2015 17:43:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-02-20T09:43:48.036-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Wipers "Is This Real?"

In the same year Californian groups like the Dead Kennedys, X, Black Flag and Circle Jerks made big splashes that almost immediately reverberated across the growing American underground landscape, the Wipers appeared to remain Portland, Oregon\'s best kept secret upon the release of &lt;i&gt;Is This Real?&lt;/i&gt;. The most obvious reason would have to be that the aforementioned groups were from the well-known cultural centers of San Francisco and Los Angeles, cities with larger scenes and a larger audience for their music than the tiny punk community of Portland at the time. Also unlike those other bands, Wipers did not tour nationally at the time, though they had actually played the previous year as part of an infamous show in L.A. that ended in a huge police-instigated riot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, that last part was part of singer/guitarist Greg Sage\'s original plan to not even play live at all while spitting out 15 records over a ten year period. They reneged on no live performances early on, and gained a reputation for being an intense, formidable live act in the Pacific Northwest. &lt;i&gt;Is This Real? &lt;/i&gt;captures their fury and energy with more purity than any of their subsequent records, with plenty of tracks ("Mystery", "Wait a Minute", "Is This Real?") that could be classified as punk-pop or even new wave and are surprisingly bright compared to the ominous "Alien Boy", "Return of the Rat" and "D-7". It\'s the latter group of songs that would be a seminal blueprint for Seattle "grunge", with their droning, minor-key melodies and Sage\'s distinctive fuzzy guitar work, and which made the band unique in the punk community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken as a whole, &lt;i&gt;Is This Real? &lt;/i&gt;is as exciting and important a debut album as X\'s &lt;i&gt;Los Angeles&lt;/i&gt; or Dead Kennedys\' &lt;i&gt;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&lt;/i&gt;, albeit in its own unique way, and yet the group was just getting started; its 1981 follow-up &lt;i&gt;Youth of America&lt;/i&gt; branched out into more experimental song structures and darker subject matter, and garnered Wipers attention outside the Pacific Northwest for the first time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/02/wipers-is-this-real-1980.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-f1yEV60_G5w/VOdpkhdU1GI/AAAAAAAAAaQ/iGMx2pSi39I/s72-c/Wipers_-_Is_This_Real_cover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4524812202975527389</guid><pubdate>Fri, 13 Feb 2015 07:06:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-02-12T23:06:50.032-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Breeders "Pod" (1990)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uYJ0H1yZto4/VN2ZCbRL6lI/AAAAAAAAAaA/W0Qdb4POS2A/s1600/220px-The_Breeders_Pod.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uYJ0H1yZto4/VN2ZCbRL6lI/AAAAAAAAAaA/W0Qdb4POS2A/s1600/220px-The_Breeders_Pod.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Robert Christgau, often dubbed "the dean of American rock critics", was quoted saying of The Breeders that on their 1990 debut they didn\'t sound like a real band. Elsewhere, they were derided as merely "an art project". That\'s a much too glib, narrow interpretation, of course, but it\'s true that the group came into being as merely a side-project,&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;in this case a collaboration between Pixies bassist Kim Deal and Throwing Muses guitarist Tanya Donelly, devised as a way for them to flex their songwriting muscles more than they were allowed to do in bands under the charismatic leadership of a Black Francis or Kristin Hersh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Pod&lt;/i&gt;, recorded with Steve Albini, successfully bridges the bare-bones, angular feel of &lt;i&gt;Surfer Rosa &lt;/i&gt;(also produced by Albini) and the ethereal, otherworldly quality of the Muses\' early work, though the singing and songwriting isn\'t as equally divided as you\'d expect; come to think of it, Kim Deal dominates the record lock, stock and barrel. She handles nearly all the album\'s vocals and dominates the songwriting credits, with the exception of course of their imaginative take on The Beatles\' "Happiness is a Warm Gun", and Donelly only assists in writing one song ("Only in 3\'s"). It\'s perhaps only inevitable that it would follow this trajectory, because the group\'s very name had already been used years before as the moniker Kim and her twin sister Kelley (who would later join this new band) went under when performing as a country-folk duo as teenagers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, while it unfortunately may not be filled to the brim with songs as solid as some of Deal and Donelly\'s rather scarce songwriting contributions to their respective bands up to that time, it\'s an undoubtedly distinctive piece of work that never sounds quite like the Pixies or Throwing Muses while obviously borrowing elements of both. Deal had already established herself in the Pixies as a very different songwriter with a softer, more overtly feminine quality than Black Francis on the classic "Gigantic", but she really comes into her own here with simultaneously sweet, sexy, funny and weird songs like "Doe", "Hellbound", "When I Was a Painter", "Iris" and "Fortunately Gone". It\'s as much of a treat to listen to as it surely was for her to write and sing these songs. The only drawback to the record is that it doesn\'t fully have the consistency or the pulsating energy of &lt;i&gt;Surfer Rosa &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Doolittle&lt;/i&gt;, tending to land in oftentimes hazy, drifting territory that doesn\'t always make the songs as immediately compelling as one might hope. It\'s an extremely minor criticism, indeed, because it clocks in at barely half an hour in length anyway, so nothing drags on past its welcome in the slightest. It may not be as much of a stunner as the debut albums of the Pixies or Throwing Muses, but it\'s a modest little gem that still stands up as one of the best works that either Kim Deal or Tanya Donelly have been involved in since its recording.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/02/the-breeders-pod-1990.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uYJ0H1yZto4/VN2ZCbRL6lI/AAAAAAAAAaA/W0Qdb4POS2A/s72-c/220px-The_Breeders_Pod.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4282780212679870981</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 18:15:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-30T10:15:03.299-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Miles Davis "Birth of the Cool" (1957)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyD2lylWc40/VMvCr_eJSGI/AAAAAAAAAZs/mhKWVZAt6k4/s1600/MI0002421128.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyD2lylWc40/VMvCr_eJSGI/AAAAAAAAAZs/mhKWVZAt6k4/s1600/MI0002421128.jpg" height="312" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Rarely has an album had a title as prophetic and true as Miles Davis\' &lt;i&gt;Birth of the Cool&lt;/i&gt;, the 1957 compilation of sides recorded by a nine-piece ensemble in 1949 and \'50 that were originally released at that time on 78 RPM records and essentially gave birth to West Coast "cool" jazz by bridging the gap between the antic instrumentation of bebop and the lush, full-boded arrangements of big bands. It was the first of Miles\' many incomparable stylistic innovations, and it\'s stood the test of time as an absolute cornerstone of American popular music as a whole. As typical as the playing and the tenor of the music seems today, it was indeed an entirely new sound at the end of the 40\'s, and it had an impact that changed the sound of jazz and jazz-based popular music forevermore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Old tunes like Johnny Mercer\'s gorgeous "Moon Dreams" and Jimmy Van Heusen\'s "Darn That Dream", the latter of which features vocals from Kenny Hagood and was included in issues of the album only after 1971, are given an impeccably smooth yet technically proficient take that results in a kind of mood music with a feeling, neither sonic wallpaper nor going into the hot, hectic hard bop arrangements that Davis would soon fall in love with as he abandoned the "cool jazz" he had helped create just as soon as he had already done it. As with the best jazz, it may sound inconsequential to what\'s going on outside the grooves at times, but an undercurrent of volatility and soulfulness manages to emerge from the exuberance and passion in the group\'s playing, which is an element that informed everything Miles did thereafter no matter what stylistic avenues he was trafficking in at any time or another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For an album widely considered to be so monumental, one can\'t help but feel it\'s one of those timeless pieces of art that pretty much speaks for itself. There\'s not a whole lot of adjectives to heap on it, and it\'s a testament to the album\'s effortlessness and lack of pretension. An essential jazz item and a seminal piece of American music.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/miles-davis-birth-of-cool-1957.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dyD2lylWc40/VMvCr_eJSGI/AAAAAAAAAZs/mhKWVZAt6k4/s72-c/MI0002421128.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3730693186990020101</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 17:38:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-30T09:38:30.323-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Who "The Who Sell Out" (1967)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KrObbA-hFMI/VMuzkVCGEdI/AAAAAAAAAZc/GUnKZ08MB-w/s1600/The_who_sell_out_album_front.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KrObbA-hFMI/VMuzkVCGEdI/AAAAAAAAAZc/GUnKZ08MB-w/s1600/The_who_sell_out_album_front.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With rock &amp;amp; roll itself continuing to shatter the basic sounds of its first decade of existence with stunning speed, Pete Townshend continued to push The Who from their rebellious mod roots into pop-art and psychedelic territory with &lt;i&gt;The Who Sell Out&lt;/i&gt;, released in late 1967 after they\'d finally begun to make a significant dent in the American mass audience with their legendary appearances at the Monterey Pop Festival and on "The Smothers Brothers Show" (not to mention a notoriously ill-advised tour supporting The Monkees). These ideas had already been previewed with the mini-opera "A Quick One, While He\'s Away" a year earlier, but &lt;i&gt;The Who Sell Out&lt;/i&gt; is a full realization of the concept of a song collage, stitching the album\'s songs together not by a story as was the case with "A Quick One", but by a more intriguing, Warholian conceptual move with a number of amusing faux advertisements which were meant to mimic the presentation of a UK pirate radio station of the era.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\'t let all that fool you; the album\'s strength is, as usual, in Townshend\'s excellent, idiosyncratic songs, which include the hit "I Can See for Miles" and the strange character sketch "Mary Anne With the Shaky Hand", and the equally amusing and heartfelt vulnerability of "Tattoo". Unfortunately, the album\'s conceptual unity begins to come undone towards the end,&amp;nbsp; but if the album\'s 1995 CD reissue is any indication with its bonus tracks that include a number of fake jingles that didn\'t make the cut, this may have been (no pun intended) a legal matter more than anything else. It is indeed a matter of public record that a number of real jingle-writers and companies in Britain initiated legal action against The Who, or were at least "offended" by their mockery in the album\'s wake, not unlike the litigation that sampling in hip-hop and electronic music incurred decades later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although side one is the stronger half of the album, side two is almost as strong and notably contains the first hints of Townshend\'s interest in spirituality ("I Can\'t Reach You) as well as showcasing a softer side to this group of hard rockers than had ever been made apparent before ("Sunrise"), pointing the way toward the lofty rock opera &lt;i&gt;Tommy&lt;/i&gt; and the grand, introspective stadium rock of &lt;i&gt;Who\'s Next &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Quadrophenia&lt;/i&gt;. To sum up, &lt;i&gt;The Who Sell Out&lt;/i&gt; was the end of The Who\'s first era and the beginning of its second, the latter of which just so happened to bring them far greater commercial success (especially in America) than the first and marked almost an entirely different band from the one behind songs like "I Can\'t Explain" and "My Generation". It\'s one of their best full-lengths, of course, and also a critical turning point from which they never fully turned back.&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-who-who-sell-out-1967.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KrObbA-hFMI/VMuzkVCGEdI/AAAAAAAAAZc/GUnKZ08MB-w/s72-c/The_who_sell_out_album_front.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6328575974164285550</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 16:37:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-30T08:37:39.948-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Who "A Quick One (Happy Jack)" (1966)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mrbkGE8lzss/VMunyGogIoI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/8IcYniUZt9s/s1600/A_quick_one.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mrbkGE8lzss/VMunyGogIoI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/8IcYniUZt9s/s1600/A_quick_one.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Even as startlingly quick pop and rock music was evolving in the mid-to-late sixties, it must\'ve come as a surprise to Who fans how swiftly they moved from the hard, no-nonsense mod-rock of "My Generation" to the nine-plus-minute song collage "A Quick One, While He\'s Away" in the space of just one year. And that\'s not the only new move on their second album, 1966\'s &lt;i&gt;A Quick One&lt;/i&gt;; guitarist/songwriter Townshend remained the group\'s conceptual leader and focal point, but he encouraged bandmates Keith Moon, Roger Daltrey and John Entwistle to all contribute original material of their own. Daltrey\'s "See My Way" was hardly extraordinary, but in the case of Moon and Entwistle the results were surprising, to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moony\'s notoriously zany personality comes to the fore in his two appropriately skewed cuts, the subtly hilarious "I Need You" and the wild, bizarre instrumental "Cobwebs and Strange", where the group members play wind instruments like French horn and tuba. The hilarity of the former song, which sounds like an earnest lament, seems preposterous if you don\'t pay attention to the lyrics or know its original title, "I Need You (Like I Need a Hole in the Head)"; for only god knew what reason Moon thought The Beatles were speaking a secret language behind his back, and gets back at them here by including a cheeky John Lennon imitation during an instrumental break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entwistle, traditionally the lowest-profile member of the group despite being well-known even then as possibly rock\'s most dexterous bass player, sings in a distinctly drier and more detached manner in comparison to Townshend\'s vulnerability and Daltrey\'s hard-man bellow, and lends a surprisingly unique bent to his own two numbers: the goofy "Boris the Spider", which became one of his signature songs and features a humorously growling chorus that perhaps had a completely subliminal influence on the vocal stylings of death metal and related subgenres some decades later, and the tough "Whiskey Man".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Townshend\'s songs, of course, are still the strongest here, with the gorgeous power-pop classic "So Sad About Us" and, in the case of the US release of the album, the demented chaos of "Happy Jack". The album itself was retitled &lt;i&gt;Happy Jack&lt;/i&gt; in America by a record company nervous about the suggestive implications of its true title, but thankfully the original, groundbreaking title track was kept; how could it not be? Stitching together six completely different "movements" as one long piece about infidelity was, let\'s just say not anything you could call a typical rock &amp;amp; roll move even in the experimental 1966-67 era. In an unrelated note, it\'s ironic that swapping out the original\'s cover of Martha &amp;amp; the Vandellas\' classic "Heat Wave" with the more unique, superior original "Happy Jack" essentially repeated what had happened with the album\'s predecessor, where a cover of Bo Diddley\'s "I\'m a Man" was removed due to alleged prudishness on the part of the Americans and replaced with the superior "Instant Party". Odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a whole, it unfortunately doesn\'t gel into an album quite as cohesive and excellent as its predecessor, but it\'s chock-filled with little bits of unusual details and oddities like that previous album wasn\'t, and "A Quick One, While He\'s Away" set the stage for the group\'s next project, the full-fledged concept album &lt;i&gt;The Who Sell Out&lt;/i&gt;, which stretched out the idea of a song collage over an entire album stitched together by mock radio adverts.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-who-quick-one-happy-jack-1966.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mrbkGE8lzss/VMunyGogIoI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/8IcYniUZt9s/s72-c/A_quick_one.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6555769094013724515</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Jan 2015 15:40:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-30T07:41:54.603-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Who "The Who Sings My Generation" (1965)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RE7gXoTHOi4/VMubvmeXRXI/AAAAAAAAAZA/evojzzpLIow/s1600/220px-The_Who_sings_My_Generation.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RE7gXoTHOi4/VMubvmeXRXI/AAAAAAAAAZA/evojzzpLIow/s1600/220px-The_Who_sings_My_Generation.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A flange-addled wave of feedback in the key of F major is the first sound you hear, and as soon as Roger Daltrey bellows "Out in the Street", all hell breaks loose and a kind of rock harder and more chaotic than anything that had come before it (barring the early Kinks singles) begins. The Who\'s amphetamine-fueled combination of autodestructive performance art and fuck-you rock &amp;amp; roll rebellion bursts from the grooves of their 1965 debut LP, as those who never got to see them in their heyday with the incomparable Keith Moon attacking the drum kit, Pete Townshend\'s crashing windmill chords, and the entire group laying waste to their own instruments can just picture the group\'s unprecedented live fury simply by listening to the music. In a year which saw the boundaries of rock and pop music being pushed and prodded by the increasingly abstract songs of Dylan, The Byrds and The Beatles, The Who pushed pure sonic boundaries so hard that they helped lay much of the groundwork for heavy metal, punk rock and the mind-bending experiments of Jimi Hendrix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The classics, of course, are the title track, which is so ubiquitous 50 years later that it speaks for itself at this point; the effervescent power-pop masterpiece "The Kids Are Alright"; and the lyrically innovative "A Legal Matter", the first song with Townshend taking the lead vocal himself. But the best and/or most famous cuts aren\'t where the album\'s quality begins and ends, as was the case with many of rock\'s earliest LP-length efforts and continues to be the case today with many of the albums in the Billboard 200\'s top ten or twenty. Unlike The Rolling Stones or even The Beatles, what with their early albums being positively chock-filled with cover songs, The Who only have two here, and three on the original UK version (two from James Brown on both, plus Bo Diddley\'s "I\'m a Man" on the original). The reasons for replacing the Diddley take were prudish, but substituting it with the excellent "Circles (Instant Party)" for American audiences was hardly a regrettable decision. As raucous as "Out in the Street" is, the boundaries of pure sonic chaos get pushed even further in the all-instrumental "The Ox", with the busiest drum work captured yet on a rock record at the time and grungy, overdriven guitar. And it\'s one of the band\'s most underrated qualities, but their gleefully idiosyncratic sense of humor surfaces for the first time in "It\'s Not True" ("I haven\'t got eleven kids/I weren\'t born in Baghdad/I\'m not half-Chinese either/And I didn\'t kill my dad").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within just a year of its recording the group would move on to more ambitious and offbeat material, as heard on its immediate follow-up &lt;i&gt;A Quick One&lt;/i&gt;, along with singles like "Substitute" and&amp;nbsp; "I\'m a Boy", and of course it would only continue to expand in &lt;i&gt;The Who Sell Out &lt;/i&gt;and the rock opera &lt;i&gt;Tommy&lt;/i&gt;, but &lt;i&gt;My Generation &lt;/i&gt;is such a perfect encapsulation of everything that made the group exciting and innovative when they first blew minds at London clubs like the Marquee that it\'s stood the test of time as one of their best albums, and one of the greatest debut albums of all time.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-who-who-sings-my-generation-1965.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RE7gXoTHOi4/VMubvmeXRXI/AAAAAAAAAZA/evojzzpLIow/s72-c/220px-The_Who_sings_My_Generation.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-1111933526370515277</guid><pubdate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 06:53:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-16T22:53:36.451-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Led Zeppelin "Houses of the Holy" (1973)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MEnjqLDAxi4/VLoAXYuV_yI/AAAAAAAAAYw/9RHRDUDjuw8/s1600/Led_Zeppelin_-_Houses_of_the_Holy.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MEnjqLDAxi4/VLoAXYuV_yI/AAAAAAAAAYw/9RHRDUDjuw8/s1600/Led_Zeppelin_-_Houses_of_the_Holy.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;After reaching their commercial and artistic peak with their monolithic fourth album, Zeppelin loosened up a bit with its 1973 follow-up &lt;i&gt;Houses of the Holy&lt;/i&gt;, their first album composed of entirely original material, while at the same time continuing to expand their music beyond its initial blues rock and folk roots. Although the album ended up taking almost the entirety of 1972 to record, interrupted as usual by heavy touring along the way, you don\'t hear any trace of exhaustion in the gripping one-note flurry that opens "The Song Remains the Same", just the first of the record\'s multi-layered epics and evidence of Jimmy Page\'s growth as a guitar player, arranger and producer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was unusual enough to open the album with a six and a half minute suite, but Page brings the group even closer to progressive rock with the immediately ensuing, nearly eight-minute opus "Rain Song", which was the most overtly orchestral arrangement the group had experimented with up to that point and departed entirely from anything they had previously recorded. Even the ostensibly more traditional folk-metal of "Over the Hills and Far Away" just &lt;i&gt;feels &lt;/i&gt;different from their earlier repertoire, in a superbly subtle way that only Zeppelin could pull off at the time. As much of a departure as it is at its core, much of the album is refreshingly straightforward, with the strutting rock of "Dancing Days" and the rumbling "No Quarter" for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Houses &lt;/i&gt;also features oddball style exercises like the goofy James Brown homage "The Crunge" and the lolloping reggae of "D\'yer Mak\'er", which make for a bit of much-appreciated humor after the deathly serious mysticism the group had already made a trademark with the massive success of "Stairway to Heaven". It\'s fitting that this notorious band of album-oriented rock purists ended up wanting the latter song to be released as an honest to god single with the former as its B-side, being as they\'re both from the first Zeppelin album to have all its lyrics printed. The album marked a definite turning point for the group, the point where they were now confident to do whatever the hell they wanted to do and enjoy the spoils of being without question the very biggest band in the world during the 70\'s. It\'s the fact that this new, more relaxed feeling would almost incongruously come at the same time that the arrangements became more complex and innovative than ever before that makes &lt;i&gt;Houses of the Holy &lt;/i&gt;one of their best albums.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/led-zeppelin-houses-of-holy-1973.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MEnjqLDAxi4/VLoAXYuV_yI/AAAAAAAAAYw/9RHRDUDjuw8/s72-c/Led_Zeppelin_-_Houses_of_the_Holy.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-2484444578297041920</guid><pubdate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 06:11:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-16T22:11:03.641-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Led Zeppelin "Led Zeppelin IV" (1971)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uNkUtlEBUfw/VLn1isp8epI/AAAAAAAAAYg/6ulmcdOn1v4/s1600/Led_Zeppelin_-_Led_Zeppelin_IV.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uNkUtlEBUfw/VLn1isp8epI/AAAAAAAAAYg/6ulmcdOn1v4/s1600/Led_Zeppelin_-_Led_Zeppelin_IV.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Having established their base sound with their first two eponymous albums, then greatly expanded upon it with their third, Led Zeppelin (and, arguably, 70\'s hard rock in general) reached its absolute apex with their officially untitled fourth LP, released at the end of 1971 to much anticipation and containing a song ("Stairway to Heaven", of course) which would increasingly bore American FM radio listeners of the group as the 70\'s wore on due to its being massively overplayed. But it was played to death for good reason; "Stairway" is just one of the more remarkable tracks on what stands in hindsight as Zeppelin\'s best album from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Building up from a sombre first half, with its opening chords infamously appropriated from the group Spirit and its obscure 1968 instrumental "Taurus", and Robert Plant cynically decrying a "lady who\'s sure all that glitters is gold", it eventually ramps up into a galloping rocker over halfway into its eight minutes, and the buildup makes the loud finale much more satisfying. Compared to some of the other long-form FM staples of the time, it\'s one of the very few that managed to stay compelling all throughout its lengthy duration, and although it very well might not be their &lt;i&gt;best &lt;/i&gt;song, it\'s not a cause for lament that it\'s still their most famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And hey, that\'s only one cut, although many people who helped make the album one of rock\'s all time best sellers no doubt bought it for "Stairway" and "Stairway" alone in the 70\'s. The opening "Black Dog" is absolutely one of the group\'s heaviest, raunchiest numbers, an atmosphere that carries into the ensuing self-explanatory anthem "Rock &amp;amp; Roll" and then peters out in the English folk ballad "The Battle of Evermore" (featuring the criminally underrated Fairport Convention vocalist Sandy Denny in a duet with Plant). Finally, it shows off one of the greatest album-closers in rock history with the apocalyptic "When the Levee Breaks", a startling mixture of authentic blues and orchestral grandeur. As with many Zeppelin songs, it\'s a reworking of an ancient blues number, in this case from the husband and wife team of Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie, but with the exception of Jake Holmes\' "Dazed and Confused", they\'d never reimagine someone else\'s song so successfully as something so completely separate from its origins. John Bonham\'s absolutely monolithic drums, sampled many times in the world of hip-hop, start it off and are soon accompanied by Plant\'s shrieking harmonica, and the rest speaks for itself. Dripping with all kinds of inventive production and arrangements, it\'s one of the group\'s finest moments all by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Led Zeppelin IV &lt;/i&gt;(as the nominally untitled album is universally referred to) would eventually wind up being the group\'s best-selling album, not to mention the second-best-selling album in US history, and not only is it the group\'s undisputable masterpiece, but it stands as one of the most influential rock albums ever recorded, setting the groundwork for all the hard rock and heavy metal that was to follow in its wake and taking on a life of its own. As pompous as it may sound, it\'s one of the cornerstones of late-20th century popular music.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/led-zeppelin-led-zeppelin-iv-1971.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-uNkUtlEBUfw/VLn1isp8epI/AAAAAAAAAYg/6ulmcdOn1v4/s72-c/Led_Zeppelin_-_Led_Zeppelin_IV.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3805887306990797524</guid><pubdate>Sat, 17 Jan 2015 05:28:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-16T21:28:49.763-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Alexander "Skip" Spence "Oar" (1969)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ku1XVCVnQrg/VLnfCxdc2TI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/L5qLfYxsqtg/s1600/MI0001746001.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ku1XVCVnQrg/VLnfCxdc2TI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/L5qLfYxsqtg/s1600/MI0001746001.jpg" height="320" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Moby Grape generated such a fierce momentum when they emerged in 1967 that perhaps it was sadly inevitable that they would go from being one of the most touted bands to come out of the late 60\'s San Francisco rock scene to being a mess of drugs, mental illness and managerial problems within the span of just over a year. Group leader Alexander "Skip" Spence suffered a full-on, acid-exacerbated mental breakdown, which culminated in an incident where he tried to chop down the door of bandmate Don Stevenson\'s hotel room with an axe. After a stint in a psychiatric hospital, he supposedly drove out to Nashville by motorbike immediately upon exiting the facility and got to work on recording his first (and only) solo album, 1969\'s &lt;i&gt;Oar&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That last story has since been proven to be little more than a bit of folklore, but the album itself is still a mystifying, bizarre listen, rooted in grim, fatalistic folk and blues and (but of course) tinged with lysergic consciousness. It\'s filled with unusual sound effects, collapsing song structures, and vocals that range from a gravelly Fred Neil homage ("Cripple Creek", "Weighted Down", "Diana") to a high wisp ("Margaret/Tiger Rug", "War in Peace", "All Come to Meet Her"), and everything in-between. As outre as rock was fast becoming by the arse-end of the 60\'s, one would be hard-pressed to find many other albums of the period that sound quite like this. The nearly ten-minute closer, the frightening "Grey/Afro", was undoubtedly the album\'s most outwardly radical piece, with its funky, meandering bass, phased-out drums and incomprehensible vocals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite unsurprisingly, &lt;i&gt;Oar &lt;/i&gt;didn\'t come anywhere close to commercial acceptance, and at the time of its release was actually the lowest selling item in Columbia Records\' entire catalog, but its influence carried through the next couple of decades into the hungover, despairing indie folk of Mark "Sparklehorse" Linkous and Elliott Smith, and would eventually be honored with a song-for-song tribute album in 1999. It\'s a challenging piece of work, and fans of Moby Grape\'s wiry garage rock and country rock harmonies will be disappointed to find that &lt;i&gt;Oar &lt;/i&gt;is an entirely different beast from anything the Grape ever did, but it\'s a veritable cult classic nonetheless.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/alexander-skip-spence-oar-1969.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ku1XVCVnQrg/VLnfCxdc2TI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/L5qLfYxsqtg/s72-c/MI0001746001.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6311899643111049952</guid><pubdate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 04:44:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-11T20:57:50.236-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Neil Young "After the Gold Rush" (1970)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PNq10XcMuzY/VLNKi4ZGOCI/AAAAAAAAAYA/632aRodIeYE/s1600/220px-After_the_Gold_Rush.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PNq10XcMuzY/VLNKi4ZGOCI/AAAAAAAAAYA/632aRodIeYE/s1600/220px-After_the_Gold_Rush.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Coming off of his appearance with Crosby, Stills &amp;amp; Nash at the Woodstock Festival and the excellent &lt;i&gt;Everybody Knows This is Nowhere&lt;/i&gt;, at the beginning of the 70\'s Neil Young had most certainly "arrived" in both a commercial sense and that his idiosyncratic songwriting and performance abilities were now common knowledge among the rock &amp;amp; roll audience, as opposed to when he was in the Buffalo Springfield and often took a backseat to Stephen Stills when it came to singing and songwriting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a chameleon-like fashion that would only become more striking as his ongoing, extraordinary career progressed, he turned away from the largely hard-rock sound of his breakthrough second solo album and expanded his musical parameters for the even more successful &lt;i&gt;After the Gold Rush&lt;/i&gt;, which also followed Young\'s first album in tandem with CSN (&lt;i&gt;Deja Vu&lt;/i&gt;). After starting the album off with the gleaming "Tell Me Why", perhaps Young\'s highest falsetto vocal on record is accompanied only by an 18 year old Nils Lofgren on piano and later by a mournful horn section in the painfully beautiful title track, which, true to its title, details the immediate aftermath of the tumultuous 60\'s using apocalyptic, surreal imagery. It\'s one of those stone-cold classic songs that\'s now become a popular music standard, much like Simon &amp;amp; Garfunkel\'s contemporary "Bridge Over Troubled Water", and like that other 1970 smash-hit it\'s one of those breathtaking songs that simply speaks for itself in a way. No other song, or album for that matter, seemed to speak so concisely to the mood of the moment in 1970, and millions of listeners shared the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;True to form, he also has markedly different numbers like the stinging protest of "Southern Man" (a kissing cousin to the then-recent CSNY single "Ohio") and the &lt;i&gt;Everybody Knows&lt;/i&gt;-esque "When You Dance I Can Really Love" up his sleeve, setting in motion his well-known refusal to stick to one style of music for very long, even across the course of just one 35-minute long-player. Other highlights in particular include the sweet country-folk ballad "Only Love Can Break Your Heart" (the album\'s other huge hit) and the heady "Don\'t Let It Bring You Down", in amongst what amounts to an entirely solid and thoroughly excellent album, as well as one of the key period piece works of its time of release.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/neil-young-after-gold-rush-1970.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PNq10XcMuzY/VLNKi4ZGOCI/AAAAAAAAAYA/632aRodIeYE/s72-c/220px-After_the_Gold_Rush.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6255137297297677265</guid><pubdate>Mon, 12 Jan 2015 04:15:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-11T20:15:00.165-08:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Neil Young "Everybody Knows This is Nowhere" (1969)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OyQ7ClI4uZ8/VLNCZn5s5NI/AAAAAAAAAXw/xxg28PDrikc/s1600/220px-EverybodyKnowsThisIsNowhere.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OyQ7ClI4uZ8/VLNCZn5s5NI/AAAAAAAAAXw/xxg28PDrikc/s1600/220px-EverybodyKnowsThisIsNowhere.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Neil\'s eponymous debut album, released shortly after his exit from the short-lived but influential Buffalo Springfield at the beginning of 1969, was hardly a "much-anticipated" release when it hit the racks. Rather than it having been an inferior album, this was probably because the Springfield to begin with had never been the most commercially successful of the numerous rock bands to emerge from Los Angeles\' thriving middle-60\'s club scene, and furthermore their one ubiquitous hit ("For What It\'s Worth") was both written and sung by Stephen Stills. It would take the much stronger, more consistent &lt;i&gt;Everybody Knows This is Nowhere&lt;/i&gt;, released just four months later, to bring Young\'s immense talents to wider public notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time out, he was working with the hard-driving Californian garage-rockers Crazy Horse, who were sloppier and more endearingly ragged than either Buffalo Springfield or the about-to-be-formed Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp;amp; Young. They give a grungy menace to the incendiary album-opening "Cinnamon Girl", now a much-beloved standard in Young\'s astonishingly dense repertoire; lyrically, it\'s a bit inscrutable and doesn\'t make that much literal sense, but this quality only lends an invaluable mystique to one of Young\'s hardest, crunchiest rock songs. As if "Cinnamon Girl" wasn\'t enough, Crazy Horse only continues to perfectly complement Young\'s piercing electric guitar on the lengthy, hypnotic "Down By the River" and "Cowgirl in the Sand", which clock in at over nine and ten minutes apiece and glide along on grimy, repetitive chord changes and elemental rhythms. Not discounting the country-rock title track, the gorgeous "Round &amp;amp; Round (It Won\'t Be Long)" or the mournful "Running Dry (Requiem for the Rockets)", it\'s these three key cuts (all written while Young was suffering from a high fever) that transcended most of his previous songwriting efforts and performances on record, and made a generation of rock listeners coming of age take notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everybody Knows&lt;/i&gt;, as it turned out, would be just the beginning of a solid decade of compelling, often startlingly excellent music, and it still stands up as not only one of Young\'s best outings, but indeed as one of the very best rock albums of its time or any other.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/neil-young-everybody-knows-this-is.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OyQ7ClI4uZ8/VLNCZn5s5NI/AAAAAAAAAXw/xxg28PDrikc/s72-c/220px-EverybodyKnowsThisIsNowhere.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3213369513713290650</guid><pubdate>Fri, 09 Jan 2015 01:32:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-08T18:23:45.014-08:00</atom:updated><title>Neil Young "On the Beach" (1974)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OjOTp99rHOI/VK8k-Kij5tI/AAAAAAAAAXg/nsTuZbegJq4/s1600/MI0002178817.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OjOTp99rHOI/VK8k-Kij5tI/AAAAAAAAAXg/nsTuZbegJq4/s1600/MI0002178817.jpg" height="316" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;With the release of 1970\'s &lt;i&gt;After the Gold Rush &lt;/i&gt;and 1972\'s &lt;i&gt;Harvest&lt;/i&gt;, coupled with the immense popularity of his work with Crosby, Stills &amp;amp; Nash, Neil Young had become a bona-fide superstar and a well-regarded member of the early 70\'s singer-songwriter pantomime. As soon as he reached his commercial apotheosis, with &lt;i&gt;Harvest&lt;/i&gt;, he pulled an unexpected about-face with the rambling, universally panned film/soundtrack &lt;i&gt;Journey Through the Past&lt;/i&gt; and the gloomy live album &lt;i&gt;Time Fades Away&lt;/i&gt;, neither of which have ever seen official release in any digital format at the time of this writing. Towards the end of 1973, he recorded the bulk of what would later be released as the acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Tonight\'s the Night&lt;/i&gt;, but at this time Reprise Records rejected the disarmingly dark, off-the-cuff material that Young brought forth. He stowed it away, went back into the studio, and recorded the savage, desolate masterwork &lt;i&gt;On the Beach&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where &lt;i&gt;Tonight\'s the Night &lt;/i&gt;had been a drunken mourning for a few of Young\'s departed friends, and for the optimism of the 60\'s counterculture, &lt;i&gt;On the Beach&lt;/i&gt; saw him inching his way out of his despair without completely leaving it behind, kicking off with the upbeat "Walk On" (a weary, shrugging middle-finger to Lynyrd Skynyrd\'s "Sweet Home Alabama") and then immediately following up with the apocalyptic, &lt;i&gt;Gold Rush&lt;/i&gt;-like "See the Sky About to Rain", and the frightening "Revolution Blues". The album also sees him skewering the big, bloated business the music industry was fast becoming by 1974 ("For the Turnstiles") and serenading his actress girlfriend Carrie Snodgress ("Motion Pictures").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The almost reluctant positivity comes to a head with the closing nine-minute opus "Ambulance Blues", a poetic refutation of conceited critics and lying politicians (among many other things), by which time the remaining darkness has already come to its conclusion with the almost-as-lengthy, dread-ridden title track. It\'s a perfect sequencing that\'s telling in light of the direction Young\'s career would take after the eventual release, a whole year after &lt;i&gt;On the Beach&lt;/i&gt;, of &lt;i&gt;Tonight\'s the Night &lt;/i&gt;in June 1975. The flipped release dates weren\'t common knowledge among rock critics of the time, so inevitably &lt;i&gt;On the Beach &lt;/i&gt;was seen as an ominous precursor to the all-encroaching despair of &lt;i&gt;Tonight\'s the Night&lt;/i&gt;, and it can honestly be seen that way if one so chooses to do so, which only helps make it one of those remarkable, dense records that reveals new things with each play. It\'s that uncertain, mysterious quality, taken along with the astonishing material at hand, that makes it one of Young\'s greatest albums, and one of the great rock albums of all time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/neil-young-on-beach-1974_8.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OjOTp99rHOI/VK8k-Kij5tI/AAAAAAAAAXg/nsTuZbegJq4/s72-c/MI0002178817.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3132532240869619737</guid><pubdate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 06:16:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-04T22:16:55.553-08:00</atom:updated><title>Doctors of Madness "Late Night Movies, All Night Brainstorms" (1976)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i0gOqnxEI_s/VKoZv8X1XnI/AAAAAAAAAXI/HrMmDUWzzFI/s1600/MI0002931831.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i0gOqnxEI_s/VKoZv8X1XnI/AAAAAAAAAXI/HrMmDUWzzFI/s1600/MI0002931831.jpg" height="320" width="312" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The Doctors of Madness hit their stride at the exact borderline period straddling the death of glam and prog-rock and the birth of punk rock in England, simultaneously a clear product of the recently departed era and an oft-overlooked influence on some of the first UK punk groups with the same token. On their finest hour, the sweeping &lt;i&gt;Late Night Movies, All Night Brainstorms&lt;/i&gt;, leader Richard "Kid" Strange details a bleak post-apocalyptic landscape that can\'t help but remind listeners of David Bowie\'s &lt;i&gt;Diamond Dogs &lt;/i&gt;or Lou Reed\'s &lt;i&gt;Berlin&lt;/i&gt;, albeit managing to incorporate both the sci-fi future-shock of the former and the gloomy real-life drama of the latter in an invigorating, idiosyncratic and exhilarating way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The loose concept album is fleshed out with gorgeous, full-bodied melodies and dripping with grim imagery of death, decay, disease, neuroses and all-around dysfunction, ranging from the contemplative "I Think We\'re Alone Now" (certainly not to be confused with a certain late 80\'s pop hit) to the surging pre-punk rock of "Waiting", culminating eventually in the majestic 15-plus-minute closer "Mainlines", all augmented along the way by Celtic fiddles, shivering violins, soft acoustic guitars and painfully intense semi-orchestral arrangements. The music veers from a sensitive calm to a frenzied chaos, especially in the shifting dynamics of its two longest tracks, "Noises of the Evening" and "Mainlines", while many of Strange\'s decidedly cinematic lyrics pop out at you with either the gravity of a message from hell ("The doctors know best") or an urgent call to arms ("Tapping my feet on main street/Counting the stars in the sky/Stretching my arms and inspecting my palms/And I\'m waiting").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It all makes for an engaging, thought-provoking LP that stands as perhaps the final statement of worth from the realm of early 70\'s glam and progressive rock, and undoubtedly one of rock\'s great forgotten albums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/doctors-of-madness-late-night-movies.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i0gOqnxEI_s/VKoZv8X1XnI/AAAAAAAAAXI/HrMmDUWzzFI/s72-c/MI0002931831.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-4303196958628292481</guid><pubdate>Mon, 05 Jan 2015 04:54:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2015-01-04T20:54:39.960-08:00</atom:updated><title>Tav Falco\'s Panther Burns "Behind the Magnolia Curtain" (1981))</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B9lXwuBUoo8/VKoOm0oSVPI/AAAAAAAAAW4/UesXBdkx8II/s1600/MI0003329610.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B9lXwuBUoo8/VKoOm0oSVPI/AAAAAAAAAW4/UesXBdkx8II/s1600/MI0003329610.jpg" height="284" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Recorded in about six hours at Memphis\' legendary Ardent Studios, the Panther Burns\' 1981 debut album is early rock &amp;amp; roll played in as shambolic, wrecked-out and amateurish a fashion as it gets. The group, led by the charismatic Tav Falco and featuring cult legend Alex Chilton in its ranks, demolishes 14 forgotten rockabilly, blues and tango obscurities as a form of post-punk, avant garde conceptual art, undercut with fractured off-kilter rhythms that often make it sound as if the drummer had never played a kit prior to being called in for this session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This irreverent yet faithful take on traditional American music found Falco and the Panther Burns lumped in with the "psychobilly" of The Cramps, and deservedly so, but the Panther Burns took a slightly more subtle approach to their deconstruction of early-to-mid 20th century American pop culture and music. Falco was enamored with the jagged prose of William S. Burroughs and the "Theatre of Cruelty" exponent Antonin Artaud, not B-grade horror flicks or pinup girls. With a more cerebral feel than their psychobilly peers, the rudimentary musicianship and muddy recording make for a bit of a destabilizing experience, especially when hearing the caveman smash and bash rhythms that push along the group\'s rockin\' version of the normally breezy samba standard "Aquarela do Brasil". &lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distinctive, influential and a bit overlooked more often than not, &lt;i&gt;Behind the Magnolia Curtain &lt;/i&gt;isn\'t a sole product of either run-of-the-mill rockabilly/50\'s revivalism or fully fledged avant garde art, finding an equal parts surreal, volatile, and chaotic space of its own.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2015/01/tav-falcos-panther-burns-behind.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B9lXwuBUoo8/VKoOm0oSVPI/AAAAAAAAAW4/UesXBdkx8II/s72-c/MI0003329610.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-5028961022066516415</guid><pubdate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 07:16:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-09-20T00:16:40.246-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Clash "Give \'Em Enough Rope" (1978)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I0KggyUIMnw/Ujka36iyHGI/AAAAAAAAAUk/e9pCXyRnMG4/s1600/MI0002398217.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I0KggyUIMnw/Ujka36iyHGI/AAAAAAAAAUk/e9pCXyRnMG4/s320/MI0002398217.jpg" width="319" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The sophomore album jinx is no bit of superstition or mystery. Any band, even one as amazing and transcendent as The Clash, is going to have a hard time following up a first LP that is not only musically excellent, but also undoubtedly a defining document of its cultural moment. The Clash\'s self titled debut album, released in April 1977 at the height of the first wave of British punk, is still rightly revered as being one of rock\'s greatest first outings, and considered by some to be the album that captured the British punk scene better than any other. As a result, when the group entered the studio a year later to record their second album, they were already sat firmly between a rock and a hard place; the likelihood of them making an album just as great or better than its predecessor was slim, simply because albums as consistent and solid as the first Clash album quite simply do not come along every time any given group makes a record. It didn\'t help matters that Blue Oyster Cult producer Sandy Pearlman sat behind the boards this time out, making for a decidedly controversial partnership that added to a critical disdain that already been festering in both the UK music press and underground fanzines to a certain extent ever since The Clash signed their contract with CBS Records in early \'77.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Give \'Em Enough Rope &lt;/i&gt;boasts a much fuller and cleaner sound than its tinny, rough-hewn predecessor, but songs like the surging opener "Safe European Home" or "Tommy Gun" actually benefit from Pearlman\'s polish. Yes, for better or worse the album sounds totally different from their first and it most certainly is not equal that album quality-wise, but it also contains a few signs of The Clash\'s imminent musical maturity, which of course would find full flower on their follow-up tour de force &lt;i&gt;London Calling&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The swinging R&amp;amp;B groove of "Julie\'s Been Working for the Drug Squad", featuring piano from the recently deceased Blue Oyster Cult keyboardist Allen Lanier, recalls nothing so much as early 70\'s pub rock in the manner of Brinsley Schwarz\' "Surrender to the Rhythm", or for that matter Joe Strummer\'s own previous group The 101\'ers. It\'s hardly an unsung gem of the Clash catalog, but it\'s a welcome step in a direction apart from the thrash anthems the group had made their chief sonic trademark, and it points ahead to the diversity they would become equally renowned for in the latter half of their career. Mick Jones\' "Stay Free" recalls his heroes Mott the Hoople in terms of its sentimentality, but instead of rendering it a mournful dirge in the fashion of "The Ballad of Mott the Hoople" or "I Wish I Was Your Mother", it grafts a sweeter pop/rock sensibility onto the established sound of the group, resulting in something that\'s neither quite a ballad or a rocker but something unique, especially for The Clash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, songs like these are the exception here, not the rule. While an incendiary update of the riff to The Who\'s "I Can\'t Explain" fueled the excellent non-album single "Clash City Rockers" earlier in 1978, the very same riff provides the basis for this album\'s woefully undistinguished "Guns on the Roof", one of several songs in a certain vein that fall flat here along with "Drug-Stabbing Time" and the rather conceited closer "All the Young Punks". The latter rings especially hollow, a cross subject matter-wise between that of the aforementioned "Clash City Rockers", the previous album\'s own closer "Garageland" and "White Man in Hammersmith Palais" (another excellent \'78 single), albeit possessing almost none of the bite of any of those earlier songs. Wisely, the group would largely abandon (with the exception of 1981\'s "This is Radio Clash") the hit-or-miss trend of Clash songs about The Clash for much of the rest of their career in favor of more worked-over statements about themselves and the world around them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, &lt;i&gt;Give \'Em Enough Rope &lt;/i&gt;is just another example of the sophomore album slump, as well as a related trend in which groups make a great first album, follow it with an inferior second one and then record a great third album. It\'s not entirely great, it\'s certainly not terrible, and it\'s worth hearing just to track the group\'s progress from the youthful fury of their first album to the dizzying multicultural stew of &lt;i&gt;London Calling&lt;/i&gt;, not to mention to hear a few great tracks, even if there aren\'t enough of those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/09/the-clash-give-em-enough-rope-1978.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-I0KggyUIMnw/Ujka36iyHGI/AAAAAAAAAUk/e9pCXyRnMG4/s72-c/MI0002398217.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3586518514628755267</guid><pubdate>Tue, 10 Sep 2013 05:56:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-09-10T00:11:01.624-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Interviews</category><title>The World\'s First Internet Baby Interviews former DEAD BOYS bassist JEFF MAGNUM!</title><description>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;TO BE FEATURED IN ROCK &amp;amp; ROLL FASCISTS ISSUE #2!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pJvphGwNHG8/Ui6gpPraqiI/AAAAAAAAASU/lfyiffJ6G4U/s1600/magnum77.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pJvphGwNHG8/Ui6gpPraqiI/AAAAAAAAASU/lfyiffJ6G4U/s400/magnum77.jpg" width="336" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jeff onstage, late 1970\'s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;JEFF MAGNUM &lt;/b&gt;was one of the legendary Dead Boys&amp;nbsp; in the late 70\'s, although he wasn\'t featured on their first and best album, &lt;i&gt;Young Loud &amp;amp; Snotty&lt;/i&gt;, and now has one of his Guild Jet Star II bass guitars on display at the Rock &amp;amp; Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH. It\'s very appropriate, given that he first joined the former members of the short-lived Rocket from the Tombs in Cleveland to become a group called Frankenstein in 1975. One year later, they moved to New York, changed their name to the Dead Boys and became part of the burgeoning punk rock fray at the celebrated CBGB\'s, which of course is currently being memorialized in a film of the same name that Jeff doesn\'t care for at all. Featured below is an interview conducted via email, in which he reveals how music first moved him and how he learned about Bators\' tragic 1990 death. It should be as much a pleasure for you to read as it was for me.

font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;Once I could actually play bass, I  started listening to only the bass on rock records I liked.&amp;nbsp; John Entwistle, Bill Wyman, Jack Bruce,  all those guys.&amp;nbsp; I couldn\'t play  that stuff but I listened and learned about playing melodic bass parts, and the  bassist I learned most from was Jack Casady from Jefferson Airplane.&amp;nbsp; Alot of those songs on the early  Airplane LP\'s left me cold, but his driving, melodic bass parts made the songs  interesting to me, plus he was playing chords, octaves, using feedback,  distortion, all this stuff "traditional" &amp;nbsp;bass players were not supposed to do and  he had a unique, killer bass tone!&amp;nbsp;  I learned a ton from those early Airplane LP\'s from his playing and  applied his "driving bass" style with the Dead Boys.&amp;nbsp; To their credit, they never  complained.&amp;nbsp; And, like everybody  else, I loved The Ventures, Stooges, MC5, Alex Harvey Band, and early Alice  Cooper albums!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style="color: black;

Alot of those bands,  at the time, I couldn\'t stand because they were terrible or boring or both, but  the really good NYC bands made up for it, lemme tell ya! Dead Boys played CB\'s in 1977-78 probably  more than anybody because our "Manager" owned the joint!&amp;nbsp; We hung out in that bar everynight for a  year and it was a blast!&amp;nbsp; Lotsa  friends, lotsa yuks, lotsa beer!&amp;nbsp; On  the countless Thursdays thru Sundays (2 sets a night), we would plow thru our  songs and make the quality noise, Bators would do his thing, and everyone had a  great time!&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

font-family: Arial; font-size: x-small;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: \'Arial\',\'sans-serif\'; font-size: 10pt;"&gt;"Young Loud And Snotty" was recorded as  a demo (never meant for release) before I rejoined the band in New York, and  really great songs were wasted on that ten cent, bullshit, awful  production.&amp;nbsp; Recording the second  album was unpleasant at times because I was there to record an album, not to  take drugs and act like a bogus Keith Richards.&amp;nbsp; At one point, I was the only one in the  studio, the rest of the band gone on a drug search.&amp;nbsp; I sat there playing my bass, trying to  come up with cool parts for some of these songs and I guess Felix musta felt  sorry for me because he came into the studio, grabbed Cheetah\'s guitar and  recording engineer Steve Klein got on the drums and the 3 of us played a buncha  blues songs until they returned with their drugs and we could continue  recording.&amp;nbsp; Apart from that, when  the record was finished, Felix Pappalardi told me I should be proud of my bass  playing on the LP.&amp;nbsp; I still  am.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left;

When 18-year-old Milo Aukerman joined the group as lead vocalist for 1981\'s &lt;i&gt;Fat &lt;/i&gt;EP, it made all the difference in the world; while the two tracks on their debut single were fine songs in their own way, it was Aukerman\'s pencil-neck-geek persona combined with his gruff holler that truly made the Descendents the great band they were in their heyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\'s a great irony that the band was to have its finest moment on record&amp;nbsp; right at the same moment that they were about to go on hiatus, due to Aukerman\'s leaving to attend college at UC San Diego. Perhaps this inspired the group to make their first (and last, until 1985) long-player a doozy, and they succeeded on that front with flying colors; 1982\'s &lt;i&gt;Milo Goes to College &lt;/i&gt;is a stone-cold classic of both hardcore and punk-pop, not to mention of punk rock and/or rock &amp;amp; roll in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It opens excellently with the sing-along "Myage" (Shit, don\'t need no more") and continues within just a few minutes through other great songs like the brief, oompah-stomping "I Wanna Be a Bear", the defiant "I\'m Not a Loser", the positively enraged "Parents" and the very funny "Tonyage". Later on, the college radio hit "Suburban Home" and the all-too-brief "Kabuki Girl" have you happily nursing the exit wounds they leave behind, and the final four songs ("Marriage", "Hope", "Bikeage" and "Jean is Dead") wind up being the most melodic, vulnerable tracks here, the final one being a real-life account of the suicide of one of Aukerman\'s friends ("Now you\'re gone and I\'m alone").&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sharp contrast between the teenage snot of "I Wanna Be a Bear" and the genuinely pained "Jean is Dead" is a huge part of what makes this album such an enduring cult classic, and the record needs both of these very different kinds of songs to really work. The infectious and accurately portrayed adolescence that comes through in the likes of "Suburban Home" or "Parents" continues to inspire high school garage bands the world over, while the romantic despair of songs like "Hope" or "Bikeage" would end up being a major influence on confessional emo/post-hardcore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, &lt;i&gt;Milo Goes to College &lt;/i&gt;is still one of the most influential punk records ever made, as well as one of the best, at least in terms of American punk and hardcore. Although there are a few lyrical droppings of the ball, most notably with the idiotic "homo"-baiting that mars the end of the otherwise magnificent "I\'m Not a Loser", they also proved themselves to be highly adept songwriters for being as young as they were at the time, and there\'s not a single clunker present. It\'s the nuclear-grade strength of these songs that holds true to this day, and will always make this an album that so many listeners will have a hard time taking off their stereo for years to come.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/09/descendents-milo-goes-to-college-1982.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-r-pqYuY4Org/UivZk3YzFVI/AAAAAAAAASA/R4WwdTD2VVE/s72-c/MI0001841105.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-6142710682075763121</guid><pubdate>Fri, 06 Sep 2013 02:38:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-09-05T19:38:21.627-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Green Day "Dookie" (1994)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MuT6qLA-IdU/UikxoKuE2SI/AAAAAAAAARw/YHgO70MeDt8/s1600/MI0003136443.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="318" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MuT6qLA-IdU/UikxoKuE2SI/AAAAAAAAARw/YHgO70MeDt8/s320/MI0003136443.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;When the first generation of enraged malcontents emerged from decaying inner cities across the globe in the mid-to-late 1970\'s, not one of those young people could in their wildest imaginations have predicted the eventuality that the raw, angry music they were playing would one day not only be accepted by an entertainment industry that initially vilified everything associated with it, but marketed by it to no end to succeeding generations of young people. The world has decided to unanimously give credit to Nirvana for breaking down the barriers between punk rock and commercial success, and it is indeed an accurate claim, but the band that really led the charge for pure punk music (or at least fully punk-derived music, as opposed to punk-influenced grunge or alternative rock) being co-opted by radio and MTV was Green Day, whose 1994 smash-hit &lt;i&gt;Dookie &lt;/i&gt;perfectly captured the mood of its pop-cultural moment. On one hand, this co-optation seemed to finally validate the merits of punk rock in the eyes of a deservedly larger audience than the one that had already known it for years; on the other hand, of course, it undoubtedly robbed the music of a great deal of its original excitement, drastically reducing its capability to shock middle America and lessening its inherent danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of the effects this commercial acceptance would ultimately have on punk music and culture, and the fact that the trend would eventually result in the world having to endure the dreadful likes of Good Charlotte and Sum 41, Green Day just so happened to be a stellar punk-pop outfit already, and the album that made them stars just so happens to remain one of the best and most influential albums of its time. The clean, crisp, big and bright sound of infectious singles like "Basket Case" was just what the doctor ordered to counteract the cloud of sorrow hanging over the rock world and (arguably) America in general in the wake of Kurt Cobain\'s suicide, and although songs like "When I Come Around" boasted plenty of romantic frustration and bitterness, Billie Joe Armstrong certainly didn\'t sound like any of it was going to make him want to shoot up or slit his wrists when he sang about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green Day and their bouncy teen angst were, indeed, very much a welcome antithesis to the dourness of the grunge bands that had dominated the charts for two years at the point that &lt;i&gt;Dookie &lt;/i&gt;was released, which probably had a lot to do with why the album became so surprisingly successful. It also, of course, had much to do with the simple fact that nearly every song on the record is a winner, big hits and deep cuts alike, and it\'s the sheer strength of these melodic, tuneful thrashers that continues to endear the band and the album to new generations of fans to this day. It of course could never be equal to the likes of &lt;i&gt;Rocket to Russia &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Never Mind the Bollocks&lt;/i&gt;, in the grand scheme of things, but Green Day would never make an album quite this solid again, even if they\'d come very close with the considerably darker and more menacing &lt;i&gt;Insomniac &lt;/i&gt;one year later, and with that same token none of the other pop-punk groups that would follow the boys from Berkeley into the pop charts managed to come close to touching it.&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/09/green-day-dookie-1994.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MuT6qLA-IdU/UikxoKuE2SI/AAAAAAAAARw/YHgO70MeDt8/s72-c/MI0003136443.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-8301248632388806888</guid><pubdate>Fri, 30 Aug 2013 02:10:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-08-29T19:14:05.375-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Iggy and the Stooges "Raw Power" (1973)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ul08ETZyDPY/Uh_rMxdrqFI/AAAAAAAAARA/o1sIOqvx5Mk/s1600/220px-StoogesRawPower.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ul08ETZyDPY/Uh_rMxdrqFI/AAAAAAAAARA/o1sIOqvx5Mk/s1600/220px-StoogesRawPower.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In the music industry, as in just about any other art form or any other facet of life in general, popularity and commercial success often do not coincide with wide-ranging influence or quality. The Stooges are one of music\'s most famous (or infamous) examples, putting out two influential and now-revered albums with their original lineup in 1969-1970 only to implode due to a deadly combination of serious drug abuse and dismal record sales. It seemed as though they were doomed to be just another forgotten rock &amp;amp; roll outfit, at a time when Iggy Pop\'s outrageous onstage antics seemed absolutely impossible to successfully translate to a record-buying public that was mostly either baffled or frightened by the band\'s brutal noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across the Atlantic ocean, however, they had one particularly noteworthy fan by the name of David Bowie, who claimed Iggy as an influence on his "Ziggy Stardust" persona. His star just so happened to be rising higher and higher just as Iggy\'s couldn\'t seem to get any lower into the heroin-addled abyss he and the rest of the group were mired in. Bowie and Iggy first crossed paths in 1971 in New York, at Max\'s Kansas City, and within a year their fast friendship coupled with Bowie\'s newfound superstar status led to The Stooges\' reforming with a new lineup that saw the powerfully primitive guitarist Ron Asheton replaced with the far more technically accomplished James Williamson, while Asheton reluctantly did the same for the long-gone original bassist Dave Alexander. Bowie was also to produce the band\'s new album, to be titled &lt;i&gt;Raw Power &lt;/i&gt;and released in 1973 to the same dismal sales that had plagued their earlier work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the change in lineup came a marked change in sound from the primal, bluesy garage rock from hell that had made their eponymous debut album and the chaotic &lt;i&gt;Fun House&lt;/i&gt; so visceral and powerful. Along with this, Iggy had come under the influence of the androgynous glam rock fashion that Bowie had popularized, rubbing glitter all over his face, decked out in silver lame pants and leopard-skin prints. While these changes made for a slightly different band than the one that had made their first two albums, they weren\'t unwelcome ones; Williamson\'s chaotic leads on the immortal album-opening anthem "Search and Destroy" may take a great deal more experience for a learning guitarist to pull off than the sublimely simple "I Wanna Be Your Dog" or "No Fun", but along with Iggy\'s urgent vocal and Scott Asheton\'s pummeling drums, they make the song sound like it\'s the last the band will ever play. When they talk about Iggy and the Stooges (as they were now being billed on &lt;i&gt;Raw Power&lt;/i&gt;) being a punk rock band before punk existed, it\'s songs like this that they\'re really talking about going by sonic influence alone, and without a doubt it boasts some of the best-ever rock &amp;amp; roll lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it only gets better from there. Following the take-no-prisoners onslaught of "Search and Destroy" is the equally sinister and seductive "Gimme Danger", a twisted love song where Iggy croons to his lover that he wants to feel her disease, and he knows that she\'ll cause some kind of trouble for him at some point down the road, but it turns him on. It sounds like nothing else here or in the rest of The Stooges\' catalog, and on a personal note it was the song that originally got this writer into the band a few years back. Lesser-known items "Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell" and "Penetration" may not be as well-known by non-fans as "Search and Destroy", but they seethe with manic malevolence like nothing that had come before them, and the former song has one of the best song titles in rock history.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike their previous two albums, there\'s no Bo Diddley-derived ode to the then-current year here, but if "1969" and "1970" have a descendent on &lt;i&gt;Raw Power&lt;/i&gt; it\'s the raucous title track, which would be covered 20 years later by Guns \'n\' Roses for their &lt;i&gt;Spaghetti Incident? &lt;/i&gt;album and succinctly captures the chaos of the album as a whole in four minutes\' time. As their previous one had collapsed in the unstructured noise of "L.A. Blues", Iggy and the Stooges\' rock &amp;amp; roll party culminates this time with the prophetic "Death Trip", in which it sounds with 40 years\' hindsight like Iggy\'s singing "you\'re gonna save me" not to a woman, but to the countless bands yet to be formed who would immortalize his band\'s music as the immensely influential noise that it is in the years after the song\'s recording.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn\'t seem that way when &lt;i&gt;Raw Power &lt;/i&gt;was released in February 1973, charting at a lamentable #182 on the Billboard 200; owing to even worse drug abuse than before as well as increasingly violent, erratic performances, within one year the band would once again be no more, their notoriously chaotic final show being captured as part of what became the posthumous and poorly-recorded &lt;i&gt;Metallic K.O.&lt;/i&gt; album. But within just half a decade, the band and their final album in particular had attracted a rabid, undeniable cult audience; it would inspire punk and punk-inspired bands in the immediately ensuing decade ranging from the Sex Pistols to The Go-Go\'s, whose Belinda Carlisle says her life was changed just by seeing &lt;i&gt;Raw Power&lt;/i&gt;\'s iconic cover shot of Iggy onstage staring balefully at the audience of a legendary London gig. After the punk era, its influence never wavered, consistently listed as a favorite album by Nirvana\'s Kurt Cobain in his journals and inspiring Henry Rollins to have its title tattooed on his shoulders. It\'s no secret that it\'s one of the most influential rock albums of all time, as well as one of the greatest and most enthralling, and although it once seemed like it was destined for obscurity, more of the world discovers those facts each and every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Raw Power &lt;/i&gt;lineup, with Mike Watt standing in for the late Ron Asheton, is now reformed and released &lt;i&gt;Ready to Die&lt;/i&gt; this past April. There isn\'t a doubt in the world that although the new album is by all accounts anything but equal to their 1973 masterwork, the guys wholeheartedly deserve the attention it\'s gotten, not to mention the adoring, much larger crowds they play for these days and their ever-growing recognition as one of rock &amp;amp; roll\'s most important bands. Enough people already recognized that in 1977, but the fact that so many more do now than did forty years ago is undeniably a well-overdue blessing.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/08/iggy-and-stooges-raw-power-1973.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ul08ETZyDPY/Uh_rMxdrqFI/AAAAAAAAARA/o1sIOqvx5Mk/s72-c/220px-StoogesRawPower.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-929884550044403256</guid><pubdate>Sat, 17 Aug 2013 07:04:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-08-17T00:08:58.533-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers "Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers" (1976)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-83hKJDuM9nU/Ug8Qcnf_N4I/AAAAAAAAAQc/hdwdttKii1M/s1600/MI0001689737.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="314" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-83hKJDuM9nU/Ug8Qcnf_N4I/AAAAAAAAAQc/hdwdttKii1M/s320/MI0001689737.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;While some artists are lucky enough to score their biggest success, artistic and/or commercial, with their very first album, many more\'s humble beginnings belie the excellence they achieve later on down the line. In the case of Tom Petty, not only was his first LP outing not quite up to the level of quality later heard on &lt;i&gt;Damn the Torpedoes &lt;/i&gt;or &lt;i&gt;Hard Promises&lt;/i&gt;, but it also came at a time when his music was rather misunderstood by the world at large.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of the superstar status they would achieve in the 1980\'s, it can be difficult to comprehend today that when Tom Petty &amp;amp; the Heartbreakers first emerged with their 1976 debut album, the lion\'s share of their early press labeled them a punk/new wave act in light of their obvious lack of affinity for the progressive rock and heavy metal that largely ruled mid-70\'s FM radio, as well as perhaps the fact that the group happened to share a name with the concurrently active Johnny Thunders band responsible for such grimy punk classics as "Born to Lose" and "Chinese Rocks". In fact, a 1977 New York Times article may or may not have coined the term "pop-punk" when referring to Petty and his so-called "pop punk rock". It was at least partly because of the hasty labeling that The Heartbreakers could hardly get arrested on big-time airwaves until some time after their debut LP hit the shops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they shared with the new wavers (and certain punks) a love of basic 60\'s guitar pop and certainly valued sturdy, concise songwriting over bombast and/or complexity, there was nothing truly "punk" or "new wave" about Petty; he was a rock &amp;amp; roller, pure and simple, an effortlessly cool personality whose cocky confidence came through in songs like "Rockin\' Around (With You)" and the laid-back early minor hit "Breakdown". This isn\'t to say that the rebelliousness implicit in that self-confidence was totally unrelated to the bitterly sarcastic wit of new wave\'s "angry young men" (i.e. Elvis Costello, Graham Parker and Joe Jackson), or that The Heartbreakers\' vibrant rock &amp;amp; roll was entirely removed from the supercharged punk rock of the Ramones. It\'s to say that Petty was an old-school rocker, pure and simple, and to call him anything else would just be silly. This is anything but a bad thing; it\'s the lack of subcultural or trendy baggage that has always made his music warm and approachable, which of course is in turn what makes it very consistently solid, albeit not always great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And indeed, much of the material on The Heartbreakers\' first album was certainly not great. While it\'s teeming with the traits and tropes that remain familiar Petty hallmarks to this day, they don\'t appear to be fully fleshed-out in most of these songs, good as all of them are and stone-cold great as two of them are. There isn\'t any definite reason for this; it\'s simply a perfect example of a debut where a band is showing its promise all over the place, but hasn\'t yet perfected its sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hasn\'t perfected it, that is, until the final track. Arriving at the end of a decidedly pedestrian second side, "American Girl" was not only The Heartbreakers\' first major hit, but it also represents the moment where the band truly became more than just another bar band. A Byrds homage so obvious that Roger McGuinn himself recorded his own version for a solo LP shortly after its release as a single, the inclusion of "American Girl" is pretty much enough on its own to make owning the whole album worth it. It\'s too bad that the rest of the material isn\'t as excellent as this one track, but the whole thing is definitely good, and everybody\'s got to start somewhere, even if that somewhere isn\'t exactly great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/08/tom-petty-heartbreakers-tom-petty.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-83hKJDuM9nU/Ug8Qcnf_N4I/AAAAAAAAAQc/hdwdttKii1M/s72-c/MI0001689737.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-3846583787656459822</guid><pubdate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:56:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-07-26T01:56:36.143-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>Wipers "Over the Edge" (1983)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OMLz9ToctIU/UfI5tgYBKII/AAAAAAAAAP8/6jBL2AJSAJs/s1600/Wipers_Over_the_edge_cover.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OMLz9ToctIU/UfI5tgYBKII/AAAAAAAAAP8/6jBL2AJSAJs/s1600/Wipers_Over_the_edge_cover.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;"It\'s not the truth I see/It\'s just a mockery..."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those  words, the first from Greg Sage\'s mouth on the Wipers\' third album,  could very well serve as an introduction one of these days to a book on  the American 80\'s underground as a whole. On the title track to &lt;em&gt;Over the Edge&lt;/em&gt;,  Wipers mastermind Sage howls desperately from that much-discussed void  of low self-esteem, alienation, disconnection, rage and despair that a  legion of hardcore punk bands were traversing by 1983, but none with  nearly as much passion as Sage mustered here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The endless  post-grunge namechecking by the likes of J Mascis and Kurt Cobain over  the last 25 or so years has failed to erode the distant mystique and  ominous tension at the heart of the first three Wipers LP\'s. The title  track of \'81\'s &lt;em&gt;Youth of America&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;\'s equally  excellent predecessor, clocked in at 10:30, then not only very rare, but  nothing short un-fucking-believable coming from an American punk band  of the era. And there was nothing to suggest this was the work of  anybody else other than a band as unique as the Wipers; it chugged along  like Krautrock at high-energy, top speed, not once descending into  self-indulgent jamming and keeping up its frantic, insistent pace all  throughout its epic sweep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That album\'s follow-up was something of a different affair. The longest cut on &lt;em&gt;Over the Edge &lt;/em&gt;is just under four-and-a-half-minutes long ("So Young"), and much of the moody atmosphere of &lt;em&gt;Youth &lt;/em&gt;was  heavily reined in favor of what is inarguably, in hindsight, the best  extended showcase yet put to record for Sage\'s raw-nerve anthems of  youthful alienation. In these songs, these "So Young" characters are  living in "Doom Town", about to be pushed "Over the Edge", "The Lonely  One(s)". There could be no possible confusion as to what this guy was  singing about. The "Youth of America" hadn\'t unified against their  opposition, as Sage had urged them to do with the slogan "it\'s time we  rectify this now" two years earlier, and were being crushed both  emotionally and physically across the nation, one-by-one and in small  groups, by the brutal onslaught of misunderstanding and indifference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over the Edge&lt;/em&gt; represented the absolute pinnacle of Greg Sage\'s songwriting and the  Wipers\' sheer ferocity as a whole, and that it would be the final album  to include original drummer Sam Henry and bassist Dave Koupal is  entirely appropriate. There was nowhere else to go, creatively, after  reaching this albatross of a third record, one that would be referred to  as one of the greatest punk rock albums of all time by more than just  Kurt Cobain. The Gun Club-like "Romeo" even briefly got airplay at a few  adventurous rock radio stations, some years before Cobain meant  anything to the world at large. I don\'t even need to call it the best  record Greg Sage ever played on, with the Wipers or solo, because that  should be quite obvious by now.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/07/wipers-over-edge-1983.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OMLz9ToctIU/UfI5tgYBKII/AAAAAAAAAP8/6jBL2AJSAJs/s72-c/Wipers_Over_the_edge_cover.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item><item><guid ispermalink="false">tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5627846526557602490.post-249862041475514182</guid><pubdate>Fri, 26 Jul 2013 08:51:00 +0000</pubdate><atom:updated>2013-07-26T01:51:58.651-07:00</atom:updated><category domain="http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#">Music Reviews</category><title>The Jesus and Mary Chain "Psychocandy" (1985)</title><description>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AxE7ulMghp8/UfI4o-F_LwI/AAAAAAAAAPs/2hnnRGDThrQ/s1600/k05669zhy8t.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AxE7ulMghp8/UfI4o-F_LwI/AAAAAAAAAPs/2hnnRGDThrQ/s1600/k05669zhy8t.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Once upon a time, a half-dead gang of apathetic social deviants out  of Glasgow learned to love again. Through some of the most  uncompromising, brutal white noise ever committed to tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For  those not informed well enough of the history of "indie" rock music  prior to 1985, there was once a time when one was either a lovelorn  balladeer or a scuzzy noise merchant, and ne\'er did the two identities  mesh as one. When the Buzzcocks fused punk rock with pop, they tempered  the punk with the pop to the point where the hybrid was commercial  enough to be successful in new wave-era Britain. But Throbbing Gristle  never recorded anything that crossed over into the lowly realms of what  was considered to be "pop" in the late 70\'s, and the obvious  distinctions between noise rock and pop rock were never in doubt of  being any less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter The Jesus and Mary Chain.  After cutting demos that were much too redolent of the Ramones, another  band who fused hard rock and pop as did the British \'Cocks, for their  liking, the brothers Reid (youngest Jim &amp;amp; eldest William) cross-bred  their love of The Stooges and Velvet Underground with their equal  affection for The Ronettes and Beach Boys. The result was far from  another pop-punk fusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the &lt;em&gt;unbelievably&lt;/em&gt; blatant rip of the "Be My Baby" drum intro that opens the landmark &lt;em&gt;Psychocandy&lt;/em&gt;,  it\'s clear that a sound unlike any other is ahead. "Just Like Honey"  wasn\'t a particularly representative example of the screeching extremes  heard elsewhere on the classic debut album, but that drum intro is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a carbon copy of the recorded Ronettes song it\'s copped from. Rather  than sounding like a grandiose, snapping snare, it sounds as though it  is emanating from a huge rock festival being held in an arena at the  very bottom of a canyon that\'s 1000 miles deep. Immediately thereafter,  in comes Doug Hart\'s dirt-simple bass line and a shimmering, yet also  feedback-wracked guitar, followed finally by Jim Reid\'s sighing vocal  and, eventually, an angelic backing chanteuse. The line "Eating up the  scum is the hardest thing that I can do" is followed by the effervescent  title refrain, and that sums up the motif of &lt;em&gt;Psychocandy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One  might be inclined to accuse The Mary Chain of, in the words of George  Clinton, "making love with one stroke" by using their noise-pop trick  for nearly every song on the album, barring the gorgeous "Cut Dead", but  that only serves to make the record a relentless,  can\'t-be-bothered-to-drag-on descent from one Reid snarl/sigh to the  next. None of these songs &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; like they\'re going past the  two-minute mark, even though nearly all of them actually do. "Never  Understand" ought to be held up as an anthem of teenage boredom fully on  par with "1969" and "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", or an anthem of  individualistic pride up there with "Blue Suede Shoes". No matter, it\'s  an excellent track, and arguably the best on the album. "You Trip Me Up"  represents the true realization of the JAMC\'s melody/noise aesthetic,  riding on a lackadaisical melody that\'s almost, just faintly,  reminiscent of that for, of all tracks, "A Summer Song", but wrapped in a  fucked-up, sickened ribbon of amplifier caterwaul. &lt;em&gt;This &lt;/em&gt;was the &lt;em&gt;real&amp;nbsp; &lt;/em&gt;European "new pop" of the 80\'s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these guys were using one stroke on &lt;em&gt;Psychocandy&lt;/em&gt;, it was evident on follow-up &lt;em&gt;Darklands &lt;/em&gt;that  they\'d apparently used that trick to such powerful effect on their  debut that they could stroke it no longer. That album expanded into more  commercial college-radio territory, with far less of &lt;em&gt;Psycho&lt;/em&gt;\'s  gloriously deafening fuzz to go with it. It\'s for that reason that it  remains such a singular, celebrated work on its own, rather than as just  The Mary Chain\'s finest record or the debut album of a great group. The  ears of both My Bloody Valentine and Dinosaur Jr. were keen and open at  the sound of &lt;em&gt;Psychocandy&lt;/em&gt;, and its impact on the independent  music scene on both sides of the Atlantic is absolutely incalculable all  the way up to the day this review is being published.</description><link>http://theworldsfirstinternetbaby.blogspot.com/2013/07/the-jesus-and-mary-chain-psychocandy.html</link><author>noreply@blogger.com (Samuel Fraser Windmill)</author><media:thumbnail height="72" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AxE7ulMghp8/UfI4o-F_LwI/AAAAAAAAAPs/2hnnRGDThrQ/s72-c/k05669zhy8t.jpg" width="72" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/"></media:thumbnail><thr:total>0</thr:total></item></channel></rss>'
