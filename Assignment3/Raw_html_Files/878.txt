But the handling of these&amp;nbsp;high profile cases is not the only reason for&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;criticism levelled at the Met.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Its whole approach to dealing with historical child sexual abuse claims has been attacked. Now the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has called in a retired judge to make an inquiry into the Met&amp;rsquo;s inquiries. But the judge&amp;rsquo;s inquiry will be secret and only a summary of his conclusions will be made public. Is this the right way to deal with public unease or is it, as some say, a way of kicking a tricky and inconvenient public relations fiasco into the long grass? And is Sir Paul right to cast doubt on the way people who say they were abused should be regarded?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Operation Midland was set up following the claims of a single man called Nick, who says he himself was a victim of a paedophile ring operating in Westminster in the late 1970s and 1980s in which prominent figures in British life sexually abused children and that three of them had been murdered. Lord Bramall was cited as one of those figures. Harvey Proctor (who remains under investigation) was alleged to have conspired with the former prime minister, Edward Heath, in the murder of a child at a sex party.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In addition, Operation Midland looked into an allegation made by a woman that she had been raped in the 1960s by the late Lord Brittan, who became Margaret Thatcher&amp;rsquo;s home secretary in the mid-1980s. What made some suspect that an establishment cover-up had been in force since the 1980s was that when he was home secretary, Leon Brittan was handed by a Tory backbencher, Geoffrey Dickens, a dossier outlining alleged child sex abuse involving senior figures. Nothing happened. When asked about it years later, Lord Brittain said that he had looked at it and passed it on to the Crown Prosecution Service who had concluded there was insufficient in it on which to proceed to any criminal charges. But the dossier itself mysteriously went missing.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The evidence of Nick was said by one of Sir Bernard&amp;rsquo;s officers to be &amp;lsquo;credible and true&amp;rsquo;. This apparently sweeping endorsement of Nick&amp;rsquo;s evidence was subsequently withdrawn as being too definitive and&amp;nbsp;the Met came under criticism for, in effect, believing it despite the fact there was no other corroborative evidence.&amp;nbsp; Nick&amp;rsquo;s reliability as an accuser was not, apparently, investigated. Apparently he was simply believed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed police officers investigating such allegations had been encouraged to exercise a bias in favour of believing the claims of those who alleged they had been victims of historic sexual child abuse. This bias came in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal in which a cover-up of his paedophile activity had been in place for years and the claims of his victims appeared not to have been taken seriously. Operation Midland was determined to prove different.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But the Met&amp;rsquo;s handling of the claims of Nick have been hugely criticised. The early assertion (albeit later withdrawn) that his claims were &amp;lsquo;credible and true&amp;rsquo; went far beyond what any officer should say in public: it is for a court not a policeman to decide whether an accusation is true. Furthermore, the Met has been criticised for failing to check evidence, for leaking information to the press, and for the long periods of police bail figures under investigation, such as Lord Bramall and Paul Gambaccini, have had to endure before being told there was no case to answer.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;When, finally, Lord Bramall and the family of the late Lord Brittan were informed there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the cases, it seemed to many that a vast injustice had been perpetrated by the police against these public figures and that they deserved an apology. But Sir Bernard refuses to give one. He said: &amp;lsquo;I cannot apologise for carrying out an inquiry into a serious allegation. That&amp;rsquo;s our job, that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re here to do.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Instead he has called in a retired judge, Sir Richard Henriques, (who earlier investigated the Crown Prosecution Service&amp;rsquo;s handling of allegations of historical child sexual abuse against the late Lord Janner) to conduct an inquiry into how the Met conducted Operation Midland. Sir Richard&amp;rsquo;s inquiry will be held in secret and only a summary of its conclusions, not the full report, will be made public, though the full report will be passed on to the Goddard Inquiry into historic child abuse.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Sir Bernard has already conceded that it was a mistake to encourage officers to &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo; the claims of alleged victims, or at least that the word &amp;lsquo;believe&amp;rsquo; may have misled some officers into thinking they were required to believe that what accuser were saying was true. Instead, his guidance is for officers to be &amp;lsquo;empathetic&amp;rsquo; to people coming forward with allegations. He said: &amp;lsquo;The public should be clear that officers do not believe unconditionally what anyone tells them.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Others think the Henriques inquiry will need to come up with many further recommendations. They say that unannounced raids on people&amp;rsquo;s homes, such as Lord Bramall endured, should happen only at the end of an investigation, and not until other tests on the likely veracity of the allegations have been made. In particular more needs to be done to assess whether accusers are genuine or fantasists. They also suggest that those accused of such historic crimes should be afforded anonymity until they are charged, unless a judge decides that publicity would be beneficial by prompting other former victims to come forward.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But some think that the setting up of the Henriques inquiry is simply a PR device to kick the problems of Operation Midland into the long grass. He&amp;rsquo;ll now be able to bat off any difficult questions by saying that it&amp;rsquo;s for Henriques to answer them. Harvey Proctor was scathing about the new inquiry, dismissing it as part of a PR strategy and saying he would not cooperate with it. Sir Bernard, however, says it is the sensible way to proceed. The day after he announced the inquiry the Home Secretary Theresa May made her own announcement. Sir Bernard would be given a one-year extension to his contract as Commissioner, which was due to expire in September.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s your view? What do you think about the way the Met has handled Operation Midland? Do you think Lord Bramall and others deserve an apology from Sir Bernard? And is the setting up of the Henriques Inquiry a good idea or not? Does it matter or not that only a summary of his conclusions will be made public?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h3&gt;Let us know what you think.&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Image PA&lt;/p&gt;</summary><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/2016-02-11/PA-25482237%20Cropped.jpg?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpg"/><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/userprofile/22/John-Humphrys.jpg?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpg"/></entry><entry><title>Updating Trident and funding of political parties</title><link href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/11/updating-trident-and-political-party-funding/" rel="alternate"/><author><name>Milan Dinic</name><email>milan.dinic@yougov.com</email><uri>/people/milan.dinic/</uri></author><id>https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/11/updating-trident-and-political-party-funding/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2987/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2988/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2989/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><link href="http://yougov.co.uk/http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2987/z?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/com/graph/yougov/2987/z"/></entry><entry><title>Left-wingers like to keep it in the family</title><link href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/10/left-wingers-keep-family/" rel="alternate"/><author><name>Will Dahlgreen</name><email>will.dahlgreen@yougov.com</email><uri>/people/will.dahlgreen/</uri></author><id>https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/10/left-wingers-keep-family/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;In both Britain and the US left-wingers are more likely to say they would be upset if their child married a right-winger than vice versa&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At YouGov as well as measuring the ever-shifting political spectrum of voters, we try to analyse the deep-held and often subconscious tendencies that characterise voters from opposing ends of the political scale. &lt;a href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2015/10/02/why-right-wing-so-righteous/" target="_blank"&gt;In October we found that&lt;/a&gt;, contrary to the common conception that left-wingers are sanctimonious, people who identify as right-wing are in fact more likely to say they are, morally speaking, &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;better&lt;/span&gt; than the average British person (47% compared to 39% of those on the left).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;New YouGov research for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Times&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;challlenges another political stereotype. If a guiding principle of the left is tolerance, you might expect left-wingers to be more casual about the political makeup of their families. But in fact on both sides of the Atlantic people who identify as Labour or Democrat are more likely to say they\'d be upset if their son or daughter married a Conservative or Republican.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/15108/ALW.png" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And despite the American political system going through an unprecendented era of partisan deadlock &amp;ndash; bringing the federal government to a total shutdown in 2013 and preventing Barack Obama from achieving substantive reform in the last few years of his presidency &amp;ndash; Americans from both the left and right are less likely than their British counterparts to say they\'d be upset if a political outsider joined the family.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Left-wingers are five points less partisan on this measure in the US than in Britain (23% of Democrats would be upset if their child brought home a Republican compared to 28% of Labour identifiers thinking about their child with a Conservative), while right-wingers are three points less partisan. The difference between left and right is roughly the same in Britain and the US, although slightly greater here (a 9% gap compared to 7% in the US).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/36ehbscxjo/YouGov-The%20Times%20Results%20-%20Marrying%20different%20political%20persuasions%20-%20160122.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;See the full GB results&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ksv3f6ifv5/econToplines_20120117.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;See the full US results&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;PA image&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/14651/EMIli.png?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/png"/><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/userprofile/272/Will-Dahlgreen-2.jpg?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpg"/></entry><entry><title>Immigration and scaremongering, ad blocker and plastic surgery</title><link href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/10/immigration-and-scaremongering-ad-blocker-and-plas/" rel="alternate"/><author><name>Milan Dinic</name><email>milan.dinic@yougov.com</email><uri>/people/milan.dinic/</uri></author><id>https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/10/immigration-and-scaremongering-ad-blocker-and-plas/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2981/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2982/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2983/z" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><link href="http://yougov.co.uk/http://fatfingerapp.com/graph/yougov/2981/z?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/com/graph/yougov/2981/z"/></entry><entry><title>The Pulse: What to watch out for in New Hampshire and beyond</title><link href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/09/pulse-what-watch-out-new-hampshire-and-beyond/" rel="alternate"/><author><name>William Jordan</name><email>william.jordan@yougov.com</email><uri>/people/william.jordan/</uri></author><id>https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/09/pulse-what-watch-out-new-hampshire-and-beyond/</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Hello, I\'m Will Jordan and welcome to The Pulse.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Voting has &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/02/09/first-ballots-primary-cast-dixville-notch/OCMvp55pr4aBtdh5JzmVdL/story.html"&gt;already begun&lt;/a&gt; in the Granite State. Here\'s what you need to know:&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;ol&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do we already know who will win?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Polls show &lt;a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-presidential-republican-primary"&gt;Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-presidential-democratic-primary"&gt;Bernie Sanders&lt;/a&gt; both leading by more than 10 points in the state, but don&amp;rsquo;t be too surprised if it&amp;rsquo;s closer than that. There have been plenty of last minute surprises in New Hampshire, an &amp;ldquo;open&amp;rdquo; primary where there is a large moveable center of independents who can vote on either the Democratic or Republican side. According to a &lt;a href="http://www.monmouth.edu/assets/0/32212254770/32212254991/32212254992/32212254994/32212254995/30064771087/2114e68d-b5a1-46c5-a375-2d112a71d050.pdf"&gt;Monmouth poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted over the weekend, barely half (49%) of Granite State Republican voters were completely decided.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;How much will the "Rubio glitch&amp;rdquo; matter?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At the Republican debate Saturday Chris Christie assailed Marco Rubio for repeatedly pivoting to memorized lines about Barack Obama&amp;ndash; even after Christie called him out on it. The Sunday headlines were &lt;a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2016/02/gop-debate-rubio-chris-christie-fight-218873"&gt;brutal&lt;/a&gt;, and the punditry consensus has been overwhelmingly negative. But it&amp;rsquo;s hard to test if it has actually reached, or mattered, to voters in New Hampshire. The polling is mixed, putting Rubio anywhere between 9% and 17%, but he had been rising rapidly post-Iowa &amp;shy;&amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;Marcomentum&amp;rdquo; seems to have stalled, at the least. &lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Who gets to be the first loser?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; An indirect effect of Rubio&amp;rsquo;s fumble is a new lease on life for the other candidates vying for second place. Jeb Bush is campaigning with new energy, and leads in voter contacts, according to &lt;a href="http://monmouthpoll.blogspot.com/"&gt;one poll&lt;/a&gt;. Ted Cruz is still in the mix, despite appearing to benefit&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marco-rubio-stole-ted-cruzs-iowa-bounce/"&gt;little&lt;/a&gt; from his Iowa win. The biggest story might be Ohio governor John Kasich, who has largely avoided the spotlight &amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;shy;&amp;ndash; or the attacks &amp;ndash; and is showing the strongest signs of a late surge. Along with Rubio, all four candidates are between 10% and 15% in the polling average and it seems perfectly plausible any one of them could end up in second or fifth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another Clinton &amp;lsquo;comeback&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Bill was New Hampshire&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;comeback kid&amp;rdquo; in 1992, and Hillary defied the polls to defeat Barack Obama there in 2008. Her deficit is larger this time around, but that could work to her favor, even if it puts a win out of reach. Even if she trails by 10 when the votes are counted her campaign can point to several polls showing her 30 points behind just last week (Note: Bill lost by 8 before declaring himself the &amp;ldquo;comeback kid&amp;rdquo; in &amp;lsquo;92). If she loses by 15-20 points or more, the narrative will be different and Bernie may be ascendant. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s next?&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The next contest for Republicans is a primary in South Carolina on February 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;, the same day as the Democrats caucus in Nevada (the Democratic South Carolina primary is a week later). Trump holds wide leads in the latest South Carolina polls, but post-New Hampshire momentum could shift rapidly as candidates drop out. Rubio and Bush both plan to make it as far as South Carolina whatever happens, and both have the money to do it. Cruz has already spent a lot of time there and polls well with the state&amp;rsquo;s large evangelical population. For Democrats, Nevada and South Carolina play an equally important role. If Bernie performs well in New Hampshire, the big question becomes whether he can also win over large shares of Latino and African-American voters, who remain overwhelmingly pro-Hillary in national and state polls. If he can&amp;rsquo;t change that dynamic, his prospects for winning the Democratic primary will fade fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One more thing: President Bloomberg?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; On Monday former NYC Mayor Michael Bloomberg &lt;a href="http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/politics/michael-bloomberg-2016-election/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; reports that he was considering a run for president. Concerned by the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race, the billionaire would campaign as a moderate problem-solver. However, a &lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/02/02/little-support-president-bloomberg/"&gt;YouGov poll&lt;/a&gt; last week showed it would be a steep climb: only 4% of Americans said they would vote for Michael Bloomberg if he ran against their preferred Republican and Democratic candidates.&lt;/li&gt;\r\n&lt;/ol&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And finally here&amp;nbsp;is the primary schedule:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style="text-decoration: line-through;"&gt;Monday, February 1: Iowa caucuses&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 9: New Hampshire&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, February 20: Nevada caucus (Dem); South Carolina (GOP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tuesday, February 23: Nevada caucus (GOP)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saturday, February 27: South Carolina (Dem)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/williamjordann"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;me for&amp;nbsp;updates later tonight.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pulse is a weekly newsletter YouGov has launched ahead of the 2016 primaries and general election to give readers a one-stop-shop for the latest polling-related news from the campaign.&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;In addition to YouGov&amp;rsquo;s own&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/categories/election-2016/"&gt;extensive coverage of the election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, The Pulse gives you the five things you need to know about the state of the campaign each week (and one you don\'t need to know but we think is worth knowing anyway!).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/entry/2016-02-09/PA-25472340.jpg?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpg"/><link href="//d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/userprofile/268/Will-Jordan-2.jpg?w=300" length="100000" rel="enclosure" type="image/jpg"/></entry><entry><title>Extended Sunday trading gets public support \xe2\x80\x93 but with caveats</title><link href="https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/09/public-believe-changes-sunday-trading-hours-are-go/" rel="alternate"/><author><name>Louise Vacher</name><email>louise.vacher@yougov.com</email><uri>/people/louise.vacher/</uri></author><id>https://yougov.co.uk/news/2016/02/09/public-believe-changes-sunday-trading-hours-are-go/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As the government announces that it will be pressing ahead with plans to allow councils to extend trading hours on Sundays, YouGov data shows the public generally support the change but are wary about the impact upon employees and family life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Proponents of the change have argued that as shopping habits change, so too must retailers in order to better compete for trade.

This compares to 33% that think it is either a fairly bad or very bad proposal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p align="center"&gt;&lt;img src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/15102/Sunday%20Trading%20Bar.png" width="485" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Critics have consistently argued that the changes will be damaging to workers and smaller shops, and that there will a form of erosion in the quality of family life. 58% of respondents would be concerned that smaller stores would lose out if larger stores are open longer, as against 15% that would not be.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As for the workers themselves, 54% think they would lose out, against 19% that said they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t. Looking at home life specifically, a plurality (48% vs. 27%) said longer opening hours would be detrimental to family life.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And what does this all mean for retailers themselves? Our data underlines the opportunity the change provides &amp;ndash; especially to the large supermarkets. A fifth (21%) of respondents said that they would do more shopping on a Sunday if the changes were implemented. 12% said they would shop at a different time on a Sunday. Almost four in ten (38%) said that they would like supermarkets to be open longer, ahead of large shopping malls (27%).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s clear that consumers do see the advantages of the proposed changes from a personal perspective, but are nervous about how workers and smaller shops will be impacted.

Ecuador offered Assange asylum in 2012 after Sweden issued an arrest warrant over sexual assault charges, however&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-11047811" target="_blank"&gt;he feared&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;this would lead to him being moved to the US and put on trial for releasing secret documents. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;UN\'s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention said the UK was unfairly blocking Assange from "&lt;span&gt;access [to] the full-intended benefit&amp;rdquo; of his asylum status, as he would be arrested on leaving the embassy.&lt;img style="float: right; padding-left: 15px; padding-top: 30px;" src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-02-09/ABC.png" width="300" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;New YouGov research reveals little sympathy for Mr Assange. 66% of British people say he is &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; being arbitrarily detained &amp;ndash; "he is voluntarily avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorean embassy" &amp;ndash; while only 14% say he is and 20% don\'t know.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;There has been little change in opinion on what should be done with the Wikileaks founder over the past three years. In 2013 the most popular option (chosen by 43%) was to leave him in the embassy&amp;nbsp;and arrest and extradite him to Sweden should he choose to leave the embassy, and it still is (44%). Only 16% say he should be allowed to leave and take asylum in Ecuador, only slightly more than the 14% who say we should forcibly enter the embassy and arrest him, ignoring international law.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-02-09/JAD.png" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The public are increasingly taking a dim view of Julian Assange, however. His net favourability has decreased from -11 in 2013 to -15 in 2014 to an almost doubly negative score of -26 in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;And there is evidence he is fading from the public\'s memory.

The BBC is a case in point - in the run up to the election &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/13/bbc-labour-election" target="_blank"&gt;Labour criticised it&lt;/a&gt; for giving such prominence to fears over a deal with the SNP, and at a similar time Nigel Farage became outraged after being booed on Question Time.

At most 32% of British people say the media gets the right balance (on crime), falling behind the European average on housing, health, immigration and economics.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;On average out of the five areas British people are more likely than any other country to see the media as skewed towards the right (26% compared to 23% for Finland and 19% for France). Once the percentages for the media being biased to the left are subtracted, Britain\'s media is viewed as having a right-wing bias in all five areas, most of all on economics (net 15 points to the right).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-02-05/mediaBiasTopics.png" width="657" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Finland\'s press is seen as having similar levels of right-wing bias, but in most of the other countries the media is, in contrast, seen as more faithful to the left.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Around a quarter to a third of British people on each topic say the media gets the right balance, but disregarding these there are always more people who say the press favours the right than the left.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src="https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/inlineimage/2016-02-06/MBB.png" width="630" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;34% of British people say the press are too negative about immigration, compared to 25% who say it gets the balance about right and 24% who say it is too positive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/10235967/BBC-is-biased-toward-the-left-study-finds.html" target="_blank"&gt;An analysis&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 claimed to have found statistical evidence for left-wing bias at the BBC, saying in only 10% of reports on stories by left-wing think tanks did the BBC qualify the findings with a \'health warning\' about the&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;think tank&amp;rsquo;s views, ideological position, or connection to a political figure.

But the British government says it has no intention of doing any such thing and continues to assert that it has a legal obligation to extradite him to Sweden if he sets foot outside the embassy. Who&amp;rsquo;s right?&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Julian Assange came to international prominence when he published on WikiLeaks thousands of classified United States government diplomatic cables and military files, many of which cast America in a very bad light, not least in relation to its conduct in Iraq and Afghanistan. To many, Mr Assange became a hero overnight. To others, especially the American government, he was not just a criminal but a villain.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since June 2012, Mr Assange has been holed up in a small room at the back of the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he sought refuge after the Swedish authorities issued a European warrant for his arrest. They want him to be extradited to Sweden so that they can question him about allegations of rape and of sexual assault originally made against him in 2010. Mr Assange denies all the allegations, some of which can no longer be investigated because of the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In order to avoid extradition he&amp;nbsp; asked for political asylum, which was granted by the Ecuadorian government. He can&amp;rsquo;t &amp;nbsp;leave the embassy without risking immediate arrest.&amp;nbsp; Britain has spent nearly &amp;pound;13m keeping the embassy under surveillance in case he should leave, though the permanent police presence outside it was ended last autumn.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Mr Assange and many of his supporters believe that if he were to surrender himself to the Swedish authorities he would risk being extradited again to the United States, where it is thought he could face charges of sedition and espionage.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;In order to try to break the deadlock and regain his freedom, Mr Assange appealed to the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (WGAD), an offshoot of the UN Human Rights Group. His case was that his confinement was unlawful because he was being asked to choose between the asylum granted him and the certainty of arrest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;WGAD agreed with him. It declared: &amp;lsquo;The working group considered that Mr Assange has been subject to different forms of deprivation of liberty: initial detention in Wandsworth prison, which was followed by house arrest and his confinement in the Ecuadorian embassy.&amp;rsquo; The group criticised the Swedish authorities for seeking his extradition merely to question to him about the allegations and even before any charges had been brought.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Many people, however, have derided the ruling. They point out that &amp;nbsp;Mr Assange walked into the embassy of his own free will so it cannot be argued that he has been arbitrarily detained. Some have cast doubt on the credentials of WGAD and even on the UN Human Rights group itself. WGAD is made up of five academics, from Mexico, Benin, Australia, Ukraine and South Korea. The Australian academic took no part in the inquiry because Mr Assange is also Australian, and the Ukrainian academic disagreed with the ruling. So only three members of the panel came to the declared conclusion. Critics of WGAD argue that it almost never throws out any claim for arbitrary detention put to it, and they cast doubt on the legitimacy of the UN Human Rights group itself on the grounds that it elected to the chair of one of its committees the ambassador from Saudi Arabia, a country more often vilified for its human rights record than praised for it.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The &amp;nbsp;WGAD ruling has no legal force, so neither the Swedish authorities nor the British government is budging an inch. Downing Street said: &amp;lsquo;We have been consistently clear that Mr Assange has never been arbitrarily detained by the United Kingdom but is, in fact, avoiding lawful arrest by choosing to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy. The UK continues to have a legal obligation to extradite Mr Assange to Sweden.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Campaigners against sexual violence share the government&amp;rsquo;s view. Joan Smith, the chairwoman of the Mayor of London&amp;rsquo;s Violence Against Women and Girls Board said: &amp;lsquo;The UN ruling is completely irrelevant. Mr Assange is subject to the same lawful process that the rest of us are and the Supreme Court has found the arrest warrant against him was valid. In my view he has been desperately seeking to avoid submitting himself to this process by claiming there is a plot against him.

Two-thirds of likely Republican primary voters describe his second-place finish in Iowa as more of a &amp;ldquo;temporary setback&amp;rdquo; than a sign of serious trouble for his campaign. 54% expect Trump to win the New Hampshire primary, where he remains ahead according to &lt;a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-new-hampshire-presidential-republican-primary"&gt;recent polls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;But when asked who is most likely to win the primary overall, only 27% of Republicans cite Trump, down 30 points from &lt;a href="https://today.yougov.com/news/2016/01/31/americans-expect-trump-clinton-victories-ahead-iow/"&gt;a poll&lt;/a&gt; conducted just days before caucus night. 29% now expect Marco Rubio to be the nominee, following the Florida senator&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly strong finish in Iowa.
