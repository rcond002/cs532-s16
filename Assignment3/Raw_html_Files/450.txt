\xe2\x80\x93 Thanks to the fastest goal in Audi\xc2\xa0MLS Cup Playoffs history by <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/justin-meram">Justin Meram</a> and a late tap-in from <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/kei-kamara">Kei Kamara</a> for his 25th\xc2\xa0goal in all competitions this season, Columbus Crew SC blanked the New York Red Bulls 2-0 at MAPFRE Stadium.</p>\n<p>The win gives Crew SC the advantage heading to Red Bull Arena, where the Red Bulls will need a three-goal\xc2\xa0victory to ensure themselves a ticket to MLS\xc2\xa0Cup.</p>\n<p>In front of a packed house of fans who braved a cold Columbus night, Crew SC roared out to the fastest lead ever seen in a\xc2\xa0playoff game.</p>\n<p>On a play they\xe2\x80\x99ve run on nearly every kickoff this season, <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/wil-trapp">Wil Trapp</a> played a long ball to Kamara, who played it on to <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/ethan-finlay">Ethan Finlay</a>. The winger bounced the ball off his head for a moment before it fell to Meram, who one-timed a blazing shot past goalkeeper\xc2\xa0<a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/luis-robles">Luis Robles</a> to stun the Red Bulls and ignite the MAPFRE Stadium crowd.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2015-11-22-columbus-crew-sc-vs-new-york-red-bulls/boxscore"><strong>FULL BOXSCORE AND CHALKBOARD</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>New York wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t stay stunned for long, launching several attacks immediately after the goal that tested goalkeeper <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/steve-clark">Steve Clark</a>. But in the wake of the opener, the Red Bulls couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find a finish, putting only one of their eight first-half shots on frame.</p>\n<p>Crew SC squandered their own share of opportunities in the remainder of the first half. Notably, Finlay found himself leading a two-on-one breakaway with <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/federico-higuain">Federico Higuain</a> wide open on the inside of the field.</p>\n<p>Instead of slotting a pass to Higuain, Finlay attempted to dribble his way past\xc2\xa0New York&amp;apos;s\xc2\xa0<a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/felipe-martins" target="_blank">Felipe Martins</a>, who made\xc2\xa0a fantastic tackle in the box to save a goal. Red Bulls left back <a href="http://www.mlssoccer.com/players/kemar-lawrence" target="_blank">Kemar Lawrence</a> robbed Finlay of a goal earlier when a Meram cross nearly found the winger streaking alone on goal, but the left back\xe2\x80\x99s last-ditch slide tackle prevented a point-blank shot.</p>\n<p>The second half was largely more of the same for both teams.</p>\n<p>With all 22 men on the pitch in the same half for most of the second 45, it was a back-and-forth affair with both clubs creating half-chances and both sets of defenders making quality last-ditch efforts.</p>\n<p>In the Columbus end, <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/michael-parkhurst">Michael Parkhurst</a> and <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/tyson-wahl">Tyson Wahl</a> dueled with <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/bradley-wright-phillips">Bradley Wright-Phillips</a>, <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/mike-grella">Mike Grella</a> and <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/lloyd-sam">Lloyd Sam</a>, but none of the New York attackers could find a comfortable chance in the Crew SC box.</p>\n<p>But just when the match seemed to be stagnating, with both teams seemingly content with the scoreline, the spark Columbus needed to put the game away came from a likely source.</p>\n<p><a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/cedrick-mabwati">Cedrick Mabwati</a> \xe2\x80\x93 who has lately built a reputation as a spark off the\xc2\xa0Crew SC bench \xe2\x80\x93 entered the game in the 80th\xc2\xa0minute for Finlay, and made the impact head coach Gregg Berhalter hoped.</p>\n<p>In the 85th\xc2\xa0minute, Mabwati received the ball on the wing, he juked around <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/dax-mccarty">Dax McCarty</a> and <a href="http://mlssoccer.com/players/gonzalo-veron">Gonzalo Veron</a> and then burst past Felipe Martins for a close-range chance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2015-11-22-columbus-crew-sc-vs-new-york-red-bulls/stats"><strong>CHECK OUT STATS FROM CLB-NY</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Robles made a spectacular save with his right hand, but the ball fell directly to the league\xe2\x80\x99s most prolific goalscorer, and Kamara calmly passed the ball into the open net for the clincher. It was\xc2\xa0his first goal against the Red Bulls this season.</p>\n<p>Columbus take\xc2\xa0a two-goal lead into Red Bull Arena as the two teams will play again next Sunday in the second leg (7:30 pm ET, FS1,\xc2\xa0FOX Deportes, FOX Sports GO, TSN Go).</p>\n</article><div class="gigya-comments" data-reactid=".7ovlnvvw8w.9.1.0.3.$recap.1.0.0.8" id="article-comments"></div></img></div></div><div class="ad-wrapper" data-reactid=".7ovlnvvw8w.9.1.0.3.$recap.1.1" id="matchcenter-recap-1"></div></div></div></section></div></section></main><div class="connection-warning" data-reactid=".7ovlnvvw8w.a" style="pointer-events:none;">Connection Lost.
