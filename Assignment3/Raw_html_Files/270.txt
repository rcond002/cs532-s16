It\xe2\x80\x99s called \xe2\x80\x9cHow I Got the Story,\xe2\x80\x9d and it\xe2\x80\x99s as simple as that: A writer telling me how they went about creating a story or a series of stories, from idea through reporting and writing.</p>\n<p>First up in the series is B/R MLB Lead Writer <a href="https://twitter.com/DannyKnobler">Danny Knobler</a>, who talks about his August 2015 piece \xe2\x80\x9c<a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2540480-whats-it-like-to-be-baseballs-real-life-crash-davis">What\xe2\x80\x99s It Like to Be Baseball\xe2\x80\x99s Real Crash Davis?</a>\xe2\x80\x9d That story was about Mike Hessman of the Toledo Mud Hens, who had just broken the career record for minor league home runs\xe2\x80\x94as the fictional Davis had done in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cBull Durham.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>A big challenge Knobler faced: Hessman isn\xe2\x80\x99t a very interesting guy! That\xe2\x80\x99s not a criticism. It\xe2\x80\x99s just who he is. Knobler\xe2\x80\x99s editors thought it would be fun if he could get Hessman to talk about \xe2\x80\x9cbeing Crash Davis.\xe2\x80\x9d Knobler didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that was going to work:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I know Mike and I know that Mike\xe2\x80\x99s not the most colorful guy in the world. He\xe2\x80\x99s a very nice guy. Real good guy. Not terribly colorful. And he was unlikely to play along with exactly what they wanted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Knobler was right. Hessman was pleasant and generous with his time, but \xe2\x80\x9cnot much there in terms of exciting stories.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>To hear how Danny got a good story anyway, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA9OkrVqWvU">watch the video</a>.\xc2\xa0 <em>\xc2\xa0</em></p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div><!--end entry-->\n<div class="post-footer clear">\n<div class="category">Filed under <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/how-its-done/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in How It\'s Done">How It\'s Done</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/interviewing/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Interviewing">Interviewing</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/sports-media-program/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Sports Media Program">Sports Media Program</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/video/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Video">Video</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/writers-tips/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Writer\'s Tips">Writer\'s Tips</a></div>\n<div class="comments"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2016/01/14/danny-knobler-how-i-got-the-story-on-mike-hessman-the-real-life-crash-davis/#comments" title="Comment on Danny Knobler: How I Got the Story on Mike Hessman, the real-life Crash Davis"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="10979 http://blog.bleacherreport.com/?p=10979"><strong>1</strong></span></a></div>\n</div><!--end post footer-->\n</div><!--end post-->\n</div><!--end post-box-->\n<div class="post-box clear">\n<div class="post-10969 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-how-its-done category-sports-media-program tag-advanced-program-in-sports-media tag-advice tag-careers tag-education" id="post-10969">\n<div class="meta">\n<div class="author">Jan 8  <span>/ King Kaufman</span></div>\n</div><!--end meta-->\n<div class="post-header">\n<h2><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2016/01/08/brs-dorth-raphaely-make-yourself-invaluable-to-the-audience-and-employers/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to B/R\xe2\x80\x99s Dorth Raphaely: Make yourself invaluable, to the audience and employers">B/R\xe2\x80\x99s Dorth Raphaely: Make yourself invaluable, to the audience and employers</a></h2>\n</div><!--end post header-->\n<div class="entry clear">\n<div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_10971" style="width: 310px"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Yrpkw1Bo_400x400.jpeg"><img alt="Dorth Raphaely" class="size-medium wp-image-10971" height="300" src="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Yrpkw1Bo_400x400-300x300.jpg" title="Dorth Raphaely" width="300"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Dorth Raphaely</p></div>\n<p>Bleacher Report General Manager <a href="https://twitter.com/mr_dorth">Dorth Raphaely</a> was a guest on the <a href="https://www.copelandcoaching.com/2016/01/05/ccp84/">Copeland Coaching Podcast</a> this week, talking about how to build a career in sports.</p>\n<p>Not a coaching career. <a href="https://twitter.com/copelandcoach">Angela Copeland</a> is a career coach, and Raphaely talked about his path, from volunteering in the sports information department of Division III UC-Santa Cruz as an undergraduate through CBS Sports Interactive and Yahoo before arriving at B/R in 2011. Oh, and by the way, he was also an assistant women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach for the Banana Slugs.</p>\n<p>Whether he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about covering sports or getting ahead in your career, Raphaely hits a similar theme: Find ways to do things nobody else is doing, thus making yourself indispensable and irreplaceable.</p>\n<p>He describes one of the first stories Bleacher Report made its name on, the NFL draft:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in the day, before we came along, people really only did mock drafts at the end of the NFL season because that\xe2\x80\x99s when people knew the order that teams would be drafting. We realized by looking through a lot of data that people were really interested in mock drafts much sooner than the media was creating them. So we kind of recognized this inefficiency in the marketplace. And I think that term and that idea of looking for inefficiencies in the marketplace and serving those inefficiencies is really something that Bleacher Report has prided itself on and is really part of the DNA of our company.</p></blockquote>\n<p>That same ethic can serve an individual.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking for people that have specific skill sets and are sort of experts at that,\xe2\x80\x9d Raphaely says about the fierce competition for content-creation jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really about having a niche, being really good at it. Are you a feature writer? Are you an investigative writer? Are you a columnist? What is your niche? What\xe2\x80\x99s your expertise?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>At about 36:30, Dorth mentions the <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/apsm">Advanced Program in Sports Media</a>, or APSM, Bleacher Report\xe2\x80\x99s paid educational program in digital sportswriting. He mentions that \xe2\x80\x9cwe travel around to all these different schools\xe2\x80\x9d looking for college journalism students ready to graduate and begin their careers. We also target grad students and even early-career pros.</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve been lucky enough to be one of the people making those visits. This year we\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to get to more schools by making virtual visit via Skype, Google Hangouts or whatever\xe2\x80\x99s going to be invented for the purpose next week.</p>\n<p>Bleacher Report also has a similar program that focuses on copy editing and the many jobs that leverage that skill: The <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/apecm">Advanced Program in Editing and Content Management</a>.</p>\n<p>Both programs are year-round, with rolling admissions. They\xe2\x80\x99re not tied to the school calendar. They\xe2\x80\x99re 12 weeks, part-time, and participants are paid a stipend.

It\xe2\x80\x99s all guesswork. An analyst can say what they <em>think</em> happened, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Not unless a coach or player tells them, and if you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever listened to an NFL coach\xe2\x80\x99s press conference you probably have an idea of just how hard it is to extract information about who goofed up and why.</p></blockquote>\n<p>He makes a great point, and one any observer should keep in mind. We know what we can see. Beyond that, it very quickly gets into guesswork until we get the information we need to create informed analysis.</p>\n</div><!--end entry-->\n<div class="post-footer clear">\n<div class="category">Filed under <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/ethics/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Ethics">Ethics</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/writers-tips/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Writer\'s Tips">Writer\'s Tips</a></div>\n<div class="comments"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/12/14/nfl-analyst-we-can-only-know-so-much-if-we-werent-in-the-huddle/#comments" title="Comment on NFL analyst: We can only know so much if we weren\xe2\x80\x99t in the huddle"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="10957 http://blog.bleacherreport.com/?p=10957"><strong>1</strong></span></a></div>\n</div><!--end post footer-->\n</div><!--end post-->\n</div><!--end post-box-->\n<div class="post-box clear">\n<div class="post-10947 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-how-its-done category-notices category-on-media category-shoutouts tag-media tag-shoutouts" id="post-10947">\n<div class="meta">\n<div class="author">Dec 1  <span>/ King Kaufman</span></div>\n</div><!--end meta-->\n<div class="post-header">\n<h2><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/12/01/adweek-names-brs-joe-yanarella-digital-editor-of-the-year/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Adweek names B/R\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Yanarella Digital Editor of the Year">Adweek names B/R\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Yanarella Digital Editor of the Year</a></h2>\n</div><!--end post header-->\n<div class="entry clear">\n<div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_10953" style="width: 160px"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joe_crop_150x150.jpeg"><img alt="Joe Yanarella" class="size-full wp-image-10953" height="150" src="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Joe_crop_150x150.jpeg" title="Joe Yanarella" width="150"/></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe Yanarella</p></div>\n<p>A little bragging here, but with a message: Bleacher Report Editor in Chief <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2013/08/15/br-editor-in-chief-joe-yanarella-find-a-gap-in-the-industry-video/">Joe Yanarella</a> has been named <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/meet-bleacher-report-editor-who-trouncing-espn-social-sharing-168293">Digital Editor of the Year by Adweek</a>.</p>\n<p>Adweek honored Yanarella, who became editor in 2009, for turning B/R from \xe2\x80\x9ca place where unpaid bloggers got an ego boost with a byline\xe2\x80\x94and nothing else\xe2\x80\x9d to a place that \xe2\x80\x9chas ESPN and Sports Illustrated not only looking over their shoulders but in many cases trying to catch up with an editorial machine that\xe2\x80\x99s laser-focused on social and mobile.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>From the article, by <a href="http://www.adweek.com/contributor/christopher-heine">Christopher Heine</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dJournalism has been forced to keep up with sites like Bleacher Report,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jason Sullivan, evp and managing director at Publicis Seattle. \xe2\x80\x9cIt has the urgency of Twitter, the ability to use localization to follow your favorite team and a constantly improving level of quality and legitimacy to keep fans tuned in during the sports world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest moments.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>Not long ago, B/R was hardly on the radar of ad agencies or sports fans.

And the content that staff creates led Adweek to also name B/R as the Hottest in Sports Media on its annual <a href="http://www.adweek.com/news-gallery/technology/hot-list-24-digital-brands-startups-and-games-defined-2015-168250">Hot List</a>.</p>\n<p>That\xe2\x80\x99s the bragging part. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the message part: Heine notes that before coming to Bleacher Report, \xe2\x80\x9cYanarella carved out a ham-and-egger journalism career with print publications like the Hudson Valley News in upstate New York and Wizard magazine.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I won\xe2\x80\x99t give away Joe\xe2\x80\x99s age. He\xe2\x80\x99s younger than I am but old enough to have voted for or against Ronald Reagan for president. That also means he\xe2\x80\x99s old enough to have been well into that journalism career before the mobile revolution, before Web 2.0 and even before the web. But he remade himself not just as a digital journalist, but as an innovative leader in an area\xe2\x80\x94mobile- and social-first content\xe2\x80\x94that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist for his first quarter-century in the business.</p>\n<p>It seems to me the key to a successful media career in the foreseeable future will be the ability to remake oneself, to evolve, adapt and even lead in environments that are in flux or new. Joe Yanarella is a great example of that.</p>\n</div><!--end entry-->\n<div class="post-footer clear">\n<div class="category">Filed under <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/how-its-done/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in How It\'s Done">How It\'s Done</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/notices/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Notices">Notices</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/on-media/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in On media">On media</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/shoutouts/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Shoutouts">Shoutouts</a></div>\n<div class="comments"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/12/01/adweek-names-brs-joe-yanarella-digital-editor-of-the-year/#comments" title="Comment on Adweek names B/R\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Yanarella Digital Editor of the Year"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="10947 http://blog.bleacherreport.com/?p=10947"><strong>3</strong></span></a></div>\n</div><!--end post footer-->\n</div><!--end post-->\n</div><!--end post-box-->\n<div class="post-box clear">\n<div class="post-10926 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ethics category-on-media tag-ethics tag-media tag-reporting" id="post-10926">\n<div class="meta">\n<div class="author">Nov 13  <span>/ King Kaufman</span></div>\n</div><!--end meta-->\n<div class="post-header">\n<h2><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/11/13/the-mizzou-protests-showed-changing-views-of-the-media-and-privacy/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to The Mizzou protests showed changing views of the media and privacy">The Mizzou protests showed changing views of the media and privacy</a></h2>\n</div><!--end post header-->\n<div class="entry clear">\n<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/University_of_Missouri_-_Jesse_Hall-1.jpg"><img alt="University of Missouri" class="aligncenter wp-image-10930" height="254" src="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/University_of_Missouri_-_Jesse_Hall-1-1024x569.jpg" title="University of Missouri" width="459"/></a></p>\n<p style="text-align: left;">While racism and threats to the physical safety of black students are the most important issues amid the unrest at the University of Missouri, a controversy around the rights and responsibilities of the media has lingered all week.</p>\n<p>As you know, the chancellor of the University of Missouri and the president of the state system resigned amid growing protests over the administration\xe2\x80\x99s slow and tone-deaf response to a series of racist incidents and what black students say is an unsafe and hostile atmosphere for them on campus.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.themaneater.com/special-sections/mu-fall-2015/">Here\xe2\x80\x99s a timeline</a> of the growing tensions on campus at the Maneater, the student news outlet, and here\xe2\x80\x99s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/10/us/university-of-missouri-system-president-resigns.html">a New York Times story</a> about the two resignations. <a href="http://mic.com/articles/127914/why-a-black-student-is-going-on-hunger-strike-to-get-a-missouri-college-president-fired#.fBLoM3mhl">This Mic.com piece</a> about hunger striker Jonathan Butler lays out the grievances against system president Tim Wolfe, who resigned Monday.</p>\n<p>The media controversy arose from an incident Monday, when protesters, led by the group Concerned Student 1950\xe2\x80\x94whose name references the year blacks were finally admitted to Mizzou\xe2\x80\x94were celebrating the resignations on the Mel Carnahan Quadrangle on campus and vowing to continue to fight. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is just a beginning in dismantling systems of oppression in higher education, specifically the UM system,\xe2\x80\x9d Marshall Allen of Concerned Student 1950 <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/10/us/missouri-football-players-protest-presidents-resigns/">told CNN</a>.</p>\n<p>Tim Tai, a Mizzou student photojournalist who was on assignment for ESPN, got into a confrontation with protesters near the tent city they\xe2\x80\x99d set up as a \xe2\x80\x9cno media safe space,\xe2\x80\x9d on the quad. The incident was <a href="https://youtu.be/xRlRAyulN4o">captured on video</a> by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCoHh-0UizkcXGRd4-wb9ig">Mark Schierbecker</a>, and that video went viral.</p>\n<p><iframe frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xRlRAyulN4o" width="560"></iframe></p>\n<p>A few of the people in the video who tried to keep Tai and Schierbecker away from protesters were Mizzou staff or faculty. Some of them later apologized and may face discipline. But to me the most interesting aspect of the incident was the argument between Tai and the protesters, which in the days since has been taken up across the internet.</p>\n<p>The protesters argue that Tai, and all media, should respect their desire to keep the media out of their \xe2\x80\x9csafe space.\xe2\x80\x9d Tai\xe2\x80\x99s argument can be summed up by his comment at 1:45 of the video: \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment protects your right to be here, <em>and</em> mine.\xe2\x80\x9d He mentions at one point that there\xe2\x80\x99s a state law specifically declaring the Carnahan quad a public space.</p>\n<p>Tai, whose photos were <a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/photos/gallery/_/id/14091412/university-missouri-protests-reaction">published by ESPN.com</a>, was lauded by many journalists around the country for keeping his cool while defending his rights as a journalist. On the other hand, the arguments made by Tai and those who supported him were widely denounced by others, who argued that whatever the rights of journalists, they have an obligation to treat subjects, particularly subjects who are in danger or pain or both, more respectfully. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we underestimate how deeply broken our (media) relationship is w/minority communities,\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="https://twitter.com/WesleyLowery/status/663912625613447169">tweeted Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery</a>.</p>\n<p>Tai, I should note, said on several occasions that he was uncomfortable having become part of the story, and that his squabble with protesters was not nearly as important as the larger issues.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I\xe2\x80\x99m a little perturbed at being part of the story, so maybe let\xe2\x80\x99s focus some more reporting on systemic racism in higher ed institutions.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x94 Tim Tai (@nonorganical) <a href="https://twitter.com/nonorganical/status/663962685768253440">November 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script>It\xe2\x80\x99s also worth noting that the protesters changed their approach to the media on Tuesday.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ConcernedStudent1950?src=hash">#ConcernedStudent1950</a> Protestors have taken down the anti-media signs and are handing out a PSA welcoming media. <a href="https://t.co/jAqgDAzqGk">pic.twitter.com/jAqgDAzqGk</a></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x94 Mark Kim (@MarkJKim_) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarkJKim_/status/664130084593364993">November 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>Kyle Stokes, a public radio reporter in Seattle who went to Mizzou, wrote a blog post headlined <a href="https://kystokes.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/why-we-were-there/">Why We Were There</a> that laid out the media argument\xe2\x80\x94that the media is tasked with being on site to get the true story and tell it to the public, which demands to know it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Honestly, we saw you gathered in a public place. Although people typically do want to speak to the media when they\xe2\x80\x99re gathered in this way, we know you are under no obligation to do so. But in a public place, journalists are going to do what they are paid to do: ask the question and take the picture. And we cannot ever apologize for that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first reaction to this confrontation Monday was to side squarely with Tai. I found the actions of the protesters disturbing. I thought their argument that they had a right to exclude anyone from the quad because they\xe2\x80\x99d declared it their space was absurd.</p>\n<p>I also thought they were being undemocratic, that having won a victory, they were using their newfound power in a bullying way. In the closing seconds of the video, a mass of protesters walking in a close group push Tai out of the scene completely. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s our right to walk forward, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d one woman says. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe it\xe2\x80\x99s my right to walk forward.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99ve known fourth-grade bullies who were more subtle than that.</p>\n<p>I tweeted in support of a piece that argued much the same thing.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">\n<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good piece on the disturbing behavior of some protesters today. Simply put: This is violence. <a href="https://t.co/fv1Iw6Wq1F">https://t.co/fv1Iw6Wq1F</a></p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x94 King Kaufman (@king_kaufman) <a href="https://twitter.com/king_kaufman/status/663941094296555520">November 10, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>And then something even more disturbing to me happened. That tweet got a few dozen likes and retweets, and everyone who liked it or retweeted it whose race was apparent to me was white. And it\xe2\x80\x99s not like all my followers are white.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, I found myself arguing on Twitter with black journalists I respect. One, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it when other writers embed her tweets in their stories, wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cLook at it from their perspective. If subjected to obscene harassment for months bc of protesting, would I want 2 b bothered?\xe2\x80\x9d and argued that a good reporter should respect being told no, consider the motivations, and find other ways to get the story.</p>\n<p>A good summation of the argument against those of Tai and Stokes is made by Melissa McEwen at the Shakesville blog in a post headlined <a href="http://www.shakesville.com/2015/11/stop-just-stop.html">Stop. Just. Stop.</a></p>\n<blockquote><p>But in this country, with our reflexive reverence for a policy of \xe2\x80\x9cfree expression,\xe2\x80\x9d as if speech exists in a void, we\xe2\x80\x99re more worried about the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cintolerance\xe2\x80\x9d expressed by marginalized people who draw boundaries in defense of their own safety, because a minor restriction on a privileged person\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered right to engage in hate speech, or assert their \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to access to marginalized people\xe2\x80\x99s spaces and lives, is considered a more burdensome encroachment on freedom than the right of people at whom hate speech is directed to live a life free of rhetorical terror.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure where I stand at this point. One thing I\xe2\x80\x99m sure of is that I\xe2\x80\x99ve had to rethink some of my assumptions. The writer whose tweets I didn\xe2\x80\x99t embed above has argued that tweets by people who aren\xe2\x80\x99t public figures should not be considered fair game for journalists to reproduce. This is not a new or unique idea. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2014/03/twitter_journalism_private_lives_public_speech_how_reporters_can_ethically.html">Here\xe2\x80\x99s a story by Amanda Hess of Slate</a> from last year about a controversy around the privacy of public, which is to say unprotected, tweets.</p>\n<p>The idea that journalists should respect the \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy\xe2\x80\x9d of tweets, which are published online and <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/03/twitter-privacy/#uCKWkKmjQGqa">have been ruled public</a>, is similar to the idea that journalists should respect the privacy of a space carved out by a group of people, even if that space is on public ground.</p>\n<p>I have problems with both of those ideas. But I have a better understanding of them than I had a week ago, and, as you can see in these last few paragraphs, I\xe2\x80\x99m more likely to respect the requests of those who subscribe to them than I used to be.</p>\n<p>Social media is changing notions and definitions of what is public and what is private. Those definitions are also subject to change in what people my age tend to call the real world\xe2\x80\x94as if social media weren\xe2\x80\x99t part of the real world. We don\xe2\x80\x99t all have to agree on the definitions. But a smart, ethical reporter has to understand that those disagreements are real, and worth considering.</p>\n<p>Here\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more good reading on some of the angles around this subject:</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.columbiamissourian.com/opinion/local_columnists/dear-reader-on-an-historic-day-for-mu-protest-against/article_7b939356-8801-11e5-b36f-a3232f8e4fb3.html">DEAR READER: On a historic day for MU, protest against media wasn\xe2\x80\x99t most important</a></strong>, by Tom Warhover, Columbia Missourian</p>\n<p><strong><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/11/11/theres-a-good-reason-protesters-at-the-university-of-missouri-didnt-want-the-media-around/">There\xe2\x80\x99s a good reason protesters at the University of Missouri didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the media around</a></strong>: Students wanted to create a safe space from not only the racism they encounter on campus, but the insensitivity they encounter in the news media, by <a href="https://twitter.com/Russian_Starr">Terrell Jermaine Starr</a>, Washington Post</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/race-and-the-free-speech-diversion">Race and the Free-Speech Diversion</a></strong>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/jelani9">Jelani Cobb</a>, The New Yorker</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2015/11/university_of_missouri_football_forced_the_resignation_of_president_tim.html">The Mizzou Football Team May Be Just the Beginning</a></strong>: Don\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if more black athletes exert their political power for civil rights, by <a href="https://twitter.com/jbouie">Jamelle Bouie</a>, Slate</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/14097482/the-invisible-claim-victory-missouri-resignation-president-tim-wolfe">At Missouri, the invisible claim a victory</a></strong>, by <a href="https://twitter.com/hbryant42">Howard Bryant</a>, ESPN</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2588415-mizzou-players-turned-a-social-movement-into-a-business-decision-and-won" title="Mizzou Players Turned a Social Movement into a Business Decision\xe2\x80\x94and Won">Mizzou Players Turned a Social Movement into a Business Decision\xe2\x80\x94and Won</a></strong>, by\xc2\xa0<a href="https://twitter.com/gregcouch">Greg Couch</a>, Bleacher Report</p>\n<p><strong><a href="http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/politics/news/a39586/conservatives-use-missouri-protest-journalist/">How a Journalist Covering the Mizzou Protests Became a Political Pawn</a></strong>: Conservatives have latched onto Tim Tai as a means of discrediting the protesters, by <a href="http://twitter.com/ESQPolitics">Charles P.

Put simply, Grantland failed because it lost money and ESPN decided that the benefit Grantland brought to its brand wasn\xe2\x80\x99t worth the cost it extracted.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Travis then launches on a sort of history of disruption in sports media, finally offering 10 \xe2\x80\x9cthoughts\xe2\x80\x9d for people hoping to make a living in the industry. The first of them is \xe2\x80\x9cWriters have to understand the business of writing.\xe2\x80\x9d He compares sportswriters to the scouts in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cMoneyball\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Just like those baseball scouts for the Oakland A\xe2\x80\x99s, most sportswriters are operating with an antiquated notion of what their job is, and they have no concept how to use the tools around them to make them better at their job.</p></blockquote>\n<p>At one point in the piece, Travis had mentioned Bleacher Report and SB Nation, calling them technology companies that treat writers like commodities and don\xe2\x80\x99t pay them much. Finocchio, one of four friends who founded B/R, wrote him an email arguing that Bleacher Report is \xe2\x80\x9cvery much a content company, not a product company, not a technology company.\xe2\x80\x9d Travis asked for and got permission to <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/outkick-the-coverage/bleacher-report-founder-on-state-of-sports-media-business-110515">publish Finocchio\xe2\x80\x99s note</a>.</p>\n<p>Finocchio goes on to talk about his view of the sports media landscape, focusing on how changes on the distribution end\xe2\x80\x94from Google News driving traffic to Facebook doing so, for example\xe2\x80\x94have affected content strategy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Distribution disruption has now settled, and we\xe2\x80\x99re swinging toward a period where the publishers with the most valuable content/brands are going to separate themselves from the pack. Cable is crumbling and distribution is getting more and more fragmented with no clear end in sight. Many traditional TV brands (like their newspaper brethren) ten years ago, are going to die, and they\xe2\x80\x99re being replaced by the digital native brands that create the most valuable content. The talent (whether writers, video, audio, mixed media, other) are going to kick ass if they can actually deliver the goods. But lots of people are good. You have to be great (at something, anything).</p></blockquote>\n<p>Both pieces are long, and both are worth reading. They\xe2\x80\x99re written by two men who have been successful in the rapidly changing media landscape. In both of their stories, the losers are the people who didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand what was happening around them.</p>\n</div><!--end entry-->\n<div class="post-footer clear">\n<div class="category">Filed under <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/on-media/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in On media">On media</a></div>\n<div class="comments"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/11/06/clay-travis-dave-finocchio-discuss-the-present-and-future-of-sports-media/#comments" title="Comment on Clay Travis, Dave Finocchio discuss the present and future of sports media"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="10918 http://blog.bleacherreport.com/?p=10918"><strong>6</strong></span></a></div>\n</div><!--end post footer-->\n</div><!--end post-->\n</div><!--end post-box-->\n<div class="post-box clear">\n<div class="post-10914 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-ethics category-on-media tag-ethics tag-media tag-reporting" id="post-10914">\n<div class="meta">\n<div class="author">Oct 30  <span>/ King Kaufman</span></div>\n</div><!--end meta-->\n<div class="post-header">\n<h2><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/10/30/new-york-times-goes-way-old-school-fox-wrestles-with-ethics-in-mlb-postseason/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to New York Times goes way old school, Fox wrestles with ethics in MLB postseason">New York Times goes way old school, Fox wrestles with ethics in MLB postseason</a></h2>\n</div><!--end post header-->\n<div class="entry clear">\n<p>Two interesting journalism stories have popped up in these final stages of the baseball postseason.</p>\n<p>First, and more fun, when the New York Mets beat the Chicago Cubs in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series last week, the New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/22/sports/baseball/barrymets-layout.html">created an early-20th century sports page</a> and populated it with Dan Barry\xe2\x80\x99s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/23/sports/baseball/the-sounds-of-1908-a-fading-whisper-at-wrigley.html">delightful game story</a>, written in the language of 1908.

Francis Barry, which, Barry says, \xe2\x80\x9cevoked the whole New York Times thing.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I liked a little tidbit Barry passed along in passing. Talking about sportswriters can still write interesting game stories today, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cif you stipulate that you know the Patriots beat the Jets yesterday, you can tell them that here\xe2\x80\x99s what it was like on the ground and in the locker room. And you can still go to Ralph Branca\xe2\x80\x99s locker like [New York Post columnist] Murray Kempton did, rather than to Bobby Thomson\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>I\xe2\x80\x99ve read <a href="http://deadspin.com/5615284/stories-that-dont-suck-the-shot-heard-round-the-world-and-the-greatest-lede-ever-written">Red Smith\xe2\x80\x99s classic column</a> from that day, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never read, or heard of, Kempton\xe2\x80\x99s piece, which is a great example of a reporter <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2011/06/07/whats-your-best-advice-for-writers-yeah-you/">getting out of the pack</a>. And I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find it online. I\xe2\x80\x99d love to read it. Have you ever seen it?</p>\n<p>More seriously, Fox wrestled with a serious journalistic question during the broadcast of Game 1 of the World Series Tuesday night. As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/sports/wp/2015/10/28/why-fox-held-the-story-of-edinson-volquezs-fathers-death-even-when-most-viewers-already-knew/">Adam Kilgore of the Washington Post</a> writes, the network had to figure out what to do with the information that Kansas City Royals starting pitcher Edinson Volquez\xe2\x80\x99s father had died earlier in the day. That information was circulating on social media, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t clear whether Volquez knew.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIf they delivered [the news] to viewers,\xe2\x80\x9d Kilgore writes, Fox producers \xe2\x80\x9cbelieved there existed a nontrivial chance they would also inform a man on live television of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d Fox color analyst Harold Reynolds pointed out that the clubhouse TVs would be carrying the Fox broadcast, Kilgore writes, so Volquez would likely hear about it if Fox reported the news.</p>\n<p>Kilgore quotes Fox reporter Ken Rosenthal liberally as he recounts the conversation and thought process behind the decision not to report the story\xe2\x80\x94even though it was all over Twitter\xe2\x80\x94until Volquez left the game and the Royals let Fox know he\xe2\x80\x99d been informed of his father\xe2\x80\x99s death.</p>\n<p>Rosenthal says his instinct is always to go with the story, but in this case he and Fox asked an important question, which Andrew Seaman, Ethics Committee Chair of the Society of Professional Journalists, spells out in Kilgore\xe2\x80\x99s piece: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the importance of this information to the public?\xe2\x80\x9d Seaman points out that \xe2\x80\x9cthe world necessarily doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stop turning because [fans] didn\xe2\x80\x99t find out that this person passed away.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good journalistic conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d Rosenthal tells Kilgore. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard. It was really hard. I felt good about it the whole time. I am sure we did the right thing. It was the humane thing to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s not like reporting on a trade. This is a person\xe2\x80\x99s life.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa0</p>\n</div><!--end entry-->\n<div class="post-footer clear">\n<div class="category">Filed under <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/ethics/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in Ethics">Ethics</a>, <a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/category/on-media/" rel="category tag" title="View all posts in On media">On media</a></div>\n<div class="comments"><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/10/30/new-york-times-goes-way-old-school-fox-wrestles-with-ethics-in-mlb-postseason/#comments" title="Comment on New York Times goes way old school, Fox wrestles with ethics in MLB postseason"><span class="dsq-postid" rel="10914 http://blog.bleacherreport.com/?p=10914"><strong>2</strong></span></a></div>\n</div><!--end post footer-->\n</div><!--end post-->\n</div><!--end post-box-->\n<div class="post-box clear">\n<div class="post-10907 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-on-media tag-access tag-media" id="post-10907">\n<div class="meta">\n<div class="author">Oct 22  <span>/ King Kaufman</span></div>\n</div><!--end meta-->\n<div class="post-header">\n<h2><a href="http://blog.bleacherreport.com/2015/10/22/who-needs-who-jackson-state-clarion-ledger-in-stare-down-over-access/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link to Who needs who: Jackson State, Clarion-Ledger in stare-down over access">Who needs who: Jackson State, Clarion-Ledger in stare-down over access</a></h2>\n</div><!--end post header-->\n<div class="entry clear">\n<p>There\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting state-of-the-media conflict going on in Jackson, Miss.</p>\n<p>In response to the Jackson State football program closing practices and not making players and assistant coaches available to the media for three weeks,</p>\n<p>the Clarion-Ledger, a Gannett newspaper in Jackson, <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/sports/college/jackson-state/2015/10/19/clarion-ledger-halts-beat-coverage-jsu-sports/74232126/">announced that it would</a> \xe2\x80\x9ccease day-to-day beat coverage of Jackson State athletics until the situation can be resolved.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>In a statement published by the newspaper as an update to the story linked above, the university defended the right of coaches to decide to close practice, and said it had closed off media access to players and assistant coaches so the team could focus on adjusting to a coaching change. Head coach Harold Jackson was fired Oct. 6 and replaced by interim coach Derrick McCall, the only person in the program who has spoken to the media in recent weeks.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s unusual for this kind of conflict to blow up into a public announcement of the kind the Clarion-Ledger made. Disagreements over access are usually hashed out behind the scenes.</p>\n<p>It\xe2\x80\x99s also unusual for a football program that\xe2\x80\x99s not a major power and the subject of intense media interest to restrict access. Jackson State is an FCS school\xe2\x80\x94that stands for Football Championship Subdivision, and used to be known as Division I-AA\xe2\x80\x94with a 1-5 record. They\xe2\x80\x99ve drawn 24,457 fans to their two home games so far. Teams like that rarely try to dictate terms to the media. They\xe2\x80\x99re usually happy with any coverage they get.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, <a href="http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/10/20/college-football-sports-reporters-restrictions/74280848/">this column</a> by Billy Watkins of the Clarion-Ledger illustrates why the newspaper takes access so seriously. Watkins laments the old days of unrestricted access to players and coaches, and writes that the people who lose out in the current atmosphere of limited availability are the fans of the team.</p>\n<p>Watkins argues that Jackson State cutting off access completely makes a beat writer\xe2\x80\x99s hard job all but impossible. He says he agrees with his paper\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pull coverage, even though he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t part of that decision.</p>\n<p>Someone\xe2\x80\x99s going to blink here, probably pretty soon, and it\xe2\x80\x99ll probably be the university. A football program trying to put people in the stands wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to benefit much from alienating one of the biggest media outlets in town. But in the meantime, it\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting test of where we are.</p>\n<p>\xe2\x80\x9cJust how much is a paper\xe2\x80\x99s coverage worth to a team,\xe2\x80\x9d <a href="http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/local-newspaper-stops-covering-jackson-state-over-lack-of-access-school-says-fine-with-us.html">asks Andrew Bucholtz on Awful Announcing</a>, \xe2\x80\x9cand how much is covering the local team worth to a paper?
