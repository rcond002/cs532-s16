PLAYER ACQUISITION MECHANISMS</u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>MLS teams may acquire players and add them to their rosters via the following mechanisms:</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(A) <u>ALLOCATION PROCESS</u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The Allocation Process is the mechanism used to determine which MLS Club has first priority to acquire a player listed on the Allocation Ranking List. The list will consist of (i) select U.S. Men\xe2\x80\x99s National Team players, (ii) elite youth U.S. National Team players, or (iii) former MLS players returning to MLS after joining a non-MLS club for a transfer fee greater than $500,000.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The Allocation Ranking Order is set by taking the reverse order of the club\xe2\x80\x99s standings at the end of each MLS Season, taking playoff performance into account, with the new expansion clubs at the top of the order.\xc2\xa0</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Once the club uses its allocation ranking to acquire a player, it drops to the bottom of the list.\xc2\xa0 A ranking can be traded, provided that part of the compensation received in return is the other club\xe2\x80\x99s ranking. At all times, each club is assigned one ranking. The rankings reset at the end of each MLS League season.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>Allocation Money</strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Allocation Money is money that is available to a club in addition to its salary budget. Each MLS club receives an annual allotment of Allocation Money. In 2015, that allotment is $150,000 per club.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>A club will also receive Allocation Money in the following cases:</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>(1) Failure to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs.</div><div>(2) The transfer of a club\xe2\x80\x99s player to another club outside of MLS.</div><div>(3) Qualification for the CONCACAF Champions League.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The League will also provide all clubs that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a third Designated Player an equal amount of Allocation Money from the funds collected by the League for the purchase of the third Designated Player spots (as described further below).\xc2\xa0 In any year that the League adds an expansion club or clubs, (i) all clubs will receive an equal amount of Allocation Money and (ii) any club that loses a player in the expansion draft will receive additional Allocation Money.\xc2\xa0 New expansion clubs receive a separate amount of Allocation Money for their inaugural season.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Allocation Money can be traded by clubs. Allocation Money can be used to \xe2\x80\x9cbuy-down\xe2\x80\x9d a player\xe2\x80\x99s salary budget charge as part of managing a team\xe2\x80\x99s roster, including buying a salary budget charge below the League maximum of $436,250.\xc2\xa0 For example, a team may \xe2\x80\x9cbuy down\xe2\x80\x9d a player earning $450,000 to a budget charge of $250,000 by using $200,000 of Allocation Money.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The Allocation Money can also be applied in the following circumstances:</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><ul><li><div>To sign players new to MLS (that is, a player who did not play in MLS during the previous season).</div></li><li><div>To re-sign an existing MLS player.</div></li><li><div>In connection with the exercise of an option to purchase a player\xe2\x80\x99s rights or the extension of a player\xe2\x80\x99s contract for the second year provided the player was new to MLS in the immediately prior year.</div></li></ul><div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>Targeted Allocation Money </strong></div><div>Announced on July 8, 2015, each MLS club will receive $100,000 per year for the next five years ($500,000 total) in additional funds, referred to as Targeted Allocation Money, to invest in their roster outside of the player salary budget.\xc2\xa0</div><div>Targeted Allocation Money may be used in four ways:</div><ul><li><div>Clubs may use the funds to sign a new player provided his salary and acquisition costs are more than the maximum salary budget.</div></li><li><div>Clubs may re-sign an existing player provided he is earning more than the maximum salary budget.</div></li><li><div>Clubs may buy down the budget charge of an existing Designated Player (no longer making that player a DP) provided the club concurrently signs a new Designated Player at an investment equal to or greater than the player he is replacing.</div></li><li><div>Clubs may trade their Targeted Allocation Money to another club.</div></li></ul><div>MLS clubs may bring forward a portion or all of their allotted Targeted Allocation Money, up to $500,000, to be used in a single season on up to three players.\xc2\xa0</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Targeted Allocation Money and general Allocation Money may not be used in combination when signing or re-signing a player, or when buying down the budget charge of a Designated Player. Either Targeted Allocation Money or general Allocation Money may be used on a player in a single season, not both.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>While MLS clubs are not required to use their full $100,000 each season, they are required to use the remaining amount (of the annual $100,000) during the following year.<em>\xc2\xa0</em></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div></div><div><strong><em>NOTE: </em></strong><em>To protect the interests of MLS and its clubs during discussions with prospective players or clubs in other leagues, amounts of allocation money held by each club will not be shared publicly. \xc2\xa0</em></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(B) <u>DESIGNATED PLAYER</u> </strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The Designated Player Rule allows clubs to acquire up to three players whose salaries exceed the maximum budget charge, with the club bearing financial responsibility for the amount of compensation above each player\xe2\x80\x99s budget charge.

Clubs will not have to buy the third DP roster spot to accommodate Designated Players 23 years old and younger.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Designated Player spots are not tradable.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><em>** Age of player is determined by year (not date) of birth.</em></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(C) <u>SUPERDRAFT </u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The 2015 MLS SuperDraft consisted of four rounds for a total of 84 player selections. The first two rounds took place on Jan. 15 in Philadelphia and the final two rounds took place on Jan. 20 via conference call.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>The majority of draft prospects are NCAA college seniors who have exhausted their college eligibility. Generation adidas players and non-collegiate international players are also eligible for selection in the SuperDraft. Clubs may nominate players for the League\xe2\x80\x99s Draft-Eligible List, and only players from that list may be selected.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>Generation adidas </strong>is a joint program between MLS and adidas that is dedicated to developing exceptional domestic talent in a professional environment.\xc2\xa0 Each year, a handful of top domestic collegiate underclassmen and youth national team players are signed by the league and placed in the SuperDraft through this program. Generation adidas players may also receive an education stipend.\xc2\xa0 Importantly, Generation adidas players are on a club\xe2\x80\x99s Supplemental Roster and are not charged against the team\xe2\x80\x99s salary budget.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>Draft Order: </strong>The top two selections in 2015 went to the two new expansion teams. The following selections went to the clubs that did not qualify for the 2014 MLS Cup Playoffs beginning with the club with fewest regular season points (three points per win, one point per tie). \xc2\xa0The remaining positions were ranked by fewest regular season points among the teams that were eliminated in the same round of the MLS Cup Playoffs.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Unless claimed on waivers, a player who was drafted by a particular team through the SuperDraft and did not sign with the League, is placed on that team\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCollege Protected List\xe2\x80\x9d until December 31<sup>st</sup> of the year after the draft, after which the team loses the rights to the player.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(D) <u>TRADES</u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Players, SuperDraft picks, Allocation Money, Allocation Rankings and International Player Spots may all be exchanged in trades approved by the MLS League Office, provided all of the necessary rules regarding roster and salary budget compliance are met and the trade is completed during a valid trading period. \xc2\xa0During the season trades that involve players must occur during either the Primary Transfer Window or Secondary Transfer Window.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(E) <u>DISCOVERY PROCESS</u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Pursuant to the Discovery Process, clubs scout and sign players who are not yet under contract to MLS and who are not subject to another assignment mechanism (e.g. Allocation process, SuperDraft). To sign a player through the Discovery Process, the club must first place the player on its Discovery List.\xc2\xa0 A club may have up to seven unsigned players on its Discovery List at any time and may remove or add players at any time. \xc2\xa0A club may sign up to six players a year from its Discovery List to its senior roster (expansion teams may sign up to 10 in their inaugural season).</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><em>Conflict Resolution</em></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>If one or more clubs try to add the same player to their Discovery Lists, the club that filed the claim first will have the priority right to sign the player.\xc2\xa0 If one or more clubs submit a discovery request on the same day, then the club with the lowest points-per-game in the current MLS regular season (all clubs must have played a minimum of three regular season games) will have the priority right to sign the player.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>If a club attempts to sign a player on its Discovery List and is unable to do so, the club retains the Right of First Refusal to acquire the player in the event he is later signed by the League.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>If a club wants to sign a player on the Discovery List of another team, it may offer the team $50,000 in Allocation Money in exchange for the right to sign the player.\xc2\xa0 The team with the player on its Discovery List will then either (i) have to accept the Allocation Money and give up the right to sign the player or (ii) make the player a genuine, objectively reasonable offer.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>Special Discovery Players: </strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>In general, the total amount of the acquisition cost of a player is charged against the salary budget in the year in which it is paid. For one player on a club\xe2\x80\x99s roster (a \xe2\x80\x9cSpecial Discovery Player\xe2\x80\x9d), a club is able to amortize the total amount of acquisition costs (transfer fee) over the term of the player\xe2\x80\x99s contract. The amortized amount and the player\xe2\x80\x99s salary cannot exceed the Maximum Salary Budget Charge.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>Note: In order for MLS clubs to maintain the confidentiality from other MLS clubs of their recruiting of prospective players, the League office will not publicize the names of players on club discovery lists, nor specify if a discovery claim has been filed on a particular player.</div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div><strong>(F)\xc2\xa0<u>HOMEGROWN PLAYER SIGNINGS</u></strong></div><div>\xc2\xa0</div><div>A club may sign a player to his first professional contract without subjecting him to the MLS SuperDraft if the player has been a member of a club\xe2\x80\x99s youth academy for at least one year and has met the necessary training and retention requirements.
