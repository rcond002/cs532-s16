By doing this, you are asking them to send us certain information from those social media accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can unlink your social media accounts or control what they share from their privacy controls.</p>\n<p>Social media registration features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site.</p>\n<p>You can disassociate your NYTimes.com registration from third-party accounts any time.

Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.</p>\n<p><strong>User Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews and TimesPeople)</strong></p>\n<p>We offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on NYTimes.com and other NYT Services. "Public activities" are any actions you take on NYTimes.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media.
