It turns out, you\xe2\x80\x99d actually be wrong. Gunn said that not only are there still a few undiscovered easter eggs in the film, he says the biggest one of all has yet to be found. Gunn, who is preparing to leave for Atlanta to begin filming on Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2, took part in an impromptu Facebook Q&amp;A session with fans, answering some questions about the first film and the upcoming sequel. One fan asked Gunn, \xe2\x80\x9cHave all the easter eggs in GOTG been revealed?\xe2\x80\x9d Gunn answered, \xe2\x80\x9cThey have not all been found. No one has found the big one, really.\xe2\x80\x9d The big one. The great white whale of Marvel easter eggs. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if Gunn means this particular easter egg is literally big in terms of its size, or biggest in terms of its impact on the sequel and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are plenty of confirmed easter eggs in Guardians of the Galaxy including Cosmo the Space Dog, a Dark Elf from Thor: The Dark World appearing in a cell in The Collector\xe2\x80\x99s gallery, a cocoon believed to belong to Adam Warlock, one of the slugs from Gunn\xe2\x80\x99s horror film Slither, and even Gunn\xe2\x80\x99s dog making an appearance. Since Gunn\xe2\x80\x99s comments, no one has stepped forward with claims of a massive new easter egg, so the hunt is on. If you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve found something that has never been found before, let us know. It\xe2\x80\x99s time to get our your digital/Blu-ray copy of the film and go frame-by-frame like the nerdiest episode of True Detective until you find something. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 opens in theaters on May 5, 2017. \n\nThe 50 Coolest Marvel Easter Eggs of All-Time \n\n                                      window.photogalleryConfigs = window.photogalleryConfigs || [];\n                                      window.photogalleryConfigs.push({\n                                        "galleryUrl": "/restapp/api/galleries/blog/442/gallery/241608",\n                                        "galleryId": "tsm-photogallery-442-241608",\n                                        "showThumbs": 1,\n                                        "colorscheme": "light",\n                                        "dozIndexTweak": 1,\n                                        "refreshRate": 1,\n                                        "enableFullscreen": 1\n                                      });\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage  of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nFiled Under:\nGuardians of the Galaxy,\n                                          Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,\n                                          James Gunn\n\n\nCategories:\nMovie News,\n                                          Superheroes\n\n\n\n\nComments\n\n\n                                      Leave A Comment\n                                    \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nRecommended for You\nZergNet \r\n                 (function() {\r\n                     var zergnet = document.createElement(\'script\');\r\n                     zergnet.type = \'text/javascript\';
