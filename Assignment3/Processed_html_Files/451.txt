Nagbe played through to Lucas Melano on the right wing for a shot on goal 30 seconds after the opening whistle that had to be turned away by Dallas goalkeeper Jesse Gonzalez.\nIn the fourth minute, Portland were at it once again off Nagbe&amp;apos;s playmaking: he (again) pushed wide to Melano, whose chip shot across the goalmouth was spilled by Gonzalez before a clearance.\nIn the 21st minute, Texeira pinged a restart into the box back out to Mauro Diaz for a shot on target that was easily dealt with by Timbers \xe2\x80\x98keeper Adam Kwarasey.\nPortland\xe2\x80\x99s opener came two minutes later, when Nagbe\xe2\x80\x99s corner was flicked on by a Asprilla header; Ridgewell bundled it across the line.\nThe Timbers threatened nearly adding their second in the 47th minute, when Asprilla redirected a corner kick to the top shelf, where it was palmed over by Gonzalez.\nBut Asprilla wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be denied: In the 53rd minute, he took a touch into space before unleashing a right-footed 30-yard blast past Gonzalez and into the far, top corner.\nDallas finally began to respond in the 55th minute; Michael Barrios peeled off a contested shot in the box that flew just high. Two minutes later, Diaz played through Ryan Hollingshead for a 1-on-1 with Kwarasey \xe2\x80\x93 who was caught off his line \xe2\x80\x93 but Hollingshead&amp;apos;s shot was directed into the side netting.\nThey broke through shortly after, when Texeira tapped home a simple cross from Je-Vaughn Watson from the right flank for the crucial away goal.\nThe Timbers regained their two-goal advantage off a corner kick one minute into stoppage time; Borchers cleaned up an initial header from second-half substitute Norberto Paparatto to leave the sell-out crowd (21,144)\xc2\xa0in euphoria after their final home game of 2015.\nConnection Lost.
