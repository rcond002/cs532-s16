best to grin at one another over clenched teeth and avoid the kind of mudslinging that has characterized the Republican primary.But with one contentious contest in the rearview mirror and another fast approaching, their two campaigns are starting to get a bit feisty. Hours before the two meet in a televised town hall in New Hampshire, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s Twitter account sent this:\xc2\xa0Most progressives that I know don\'t raise millions of dollars from Wall Street.\xe2\x80\x94 Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) February 3, 2016 It was the first in a series of subtweets directed squarely at Clinton questioning her progressive bona fides.Well, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s team was not about to let Bernie have the last word, and they clapped back hard:2) Now, if you do want to make it about who\'s a "real progressive," @BernieSanders, what were you on these days? pic.twitter.com/8Q6hANYPhh\xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 3, 2016 4) Hillary\'s not running to make a point\xe2\x80\x94she\'s running to make a difference. She\'ll keep doing that. Please feel free to keep tweeting.\xe2\x80\x94 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) February 3, 2016 The Democratic debates have so far been cordial and substantive, which makes for smart politics but lousy television. If you miss the fireworks though, give both these candidates a follow.\xc2\xa0Feb 12, 2016Jeet Heer22 minutes agoAFP/Getty ImagesHow rude of Bernie Sanders to bring up the Vietnam War.Hillary Clinton made Henry Kissinger an issue in the Democratic primary by citing his praise of her tenure as secretary of state. In last night\xe2\x80\x99s debate, Sanders took the opportunity to remind viewers that Kissinger is not seen as a sage by everyone. As noted by Gawker, when Sanders brought up Vietnam, one of the PBS moderators whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, god\xe2\x80\x9d into her mic.Now, the moderator (it sounded like Judy Woodruff) could have been responding to any number of things. But it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to make the argument that this hot mic moment reveals a deep\xc2\xa0status quo bias at PBS. Over the decades, Kissinger has been a frequent guest on the flagship Newshour program, where he is invariably treated as a wise man. In the world of PBS newscasting, it\xe2\x80\x99s simply in bad taste to bring up the possibility that Kissinger\xe2\x80\x94based on his policies towards Vietnam, Cambodia, Chile, Bangladesh, and other countries\xe2\x80\x94might deserve the title of war criminal. Going against the grain of this status quo bias, which exists at other media organizations as well, is going to be a major challenge for Bernie Sanders.\xc2\xa0Ryu Spaeth2 hours agoWin McNamee/Getty ImagesHillaryland, for once, is playing it smart.If Bernie Sanders is the most on-message candidate in the 2016 race, if he has a penchant for returning time and again to his overarching worldview, and if he has abided by the plain principles of respect and positivity that he set out early in his candidacy, then Clinton has already tried several different approaches and messages in this young campaign, with the result that you never quite know which Clinton you\xe2\x80\x99re going to get. There was some speculation that she would hit Sanders hard at Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s debate, to blunt his momentum following an overwhelming victory in New Hampshire. And earlier in the day we got a glimpse of the kinds of cutting attacks her campaign can deploy, with supporter John Lewis coldly excising Sanders from any involvement in the civil rights movement.But as in 2008, when her attacks on the broadly liked Barack Obama fell flat, going negative on Sanders has only served to alienate liberals that Clinton ultimately needs to convince. It seems Clinton finally understands this; in the debate last night she insistently highlighted her areas of agreement with Sanders, lauded the ambitions of the progressive movement, and stuck close to Obama, the most unifying figure in the party. It may make for a dull debate, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a long-term game plan that makes sense for a candidate whose main problem is a progressive base that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t trust her.Alex Shephard2 hours agoDonald Trump would\xe2\x80\x99ve been totally cool with this ad.The Cruz campaign is okay with lots of stuff that would fill a more conventional campaign with shame, from a pastor who said that God sent Hitler to kill the Jews to a different pastor who said that gay people should be put to death. In both instances, the Cruz campaign stood by their guys.\xc2\xa0Team Cruz is not being cool at all about Amy Lindsay, though. Lindsay appeared in a recent Cruz ad, \xe2\x80\x9cConservatives Anonymous,\xe2\x80\x9d about a support group for people who were duped by Marco Rubio. IRL she\xe2\x80\x99s a Christian conservative who\xe2\x80\x99s appeared in softcore porn movies including\xc2\xa0Carnal Wishes,\xc2\xa0Secrets of a Chambermaid, and\xc2\xa0Insatiable Desires.Lindsay initially told BuzzFeed that the campaign knew about her filmography:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98In a cool way, then hey, then it\xe2\x80\x99s not just some old, white Christian bigot that people want to say, \xe2\x80\x98It could be, maybe, a cool kind of open-minded woman like me,\xe2\x80\x99 she said of people supporting Cruz.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0But after being called for comment on the BuzzFeed story, the Cruz campaign took down the ad and distanced itself from Lindsay.\xc2\xa0As Ezra Klein recently wrote in a piece partially about Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s shamelessness, \xe2\x80\x9cshame is our most powerful restraint on politicians who would find success through demagoguery.\xe2\x80\x9d In the controversy over the \xe2\x80\x9cConservatives Anonymous\xe2\x80\x9d ad, we finally found out what fills Ted Cruz with shame: sex stuff.\xc2\xa0Ryu Spaeth10 hours agoWin McNamara/GettyHere are the highlights from Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic debate.Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s message to Bernie Sanders was that he\xe2\x80\x99s no friend of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s, wrote Brian Beutler.Here\xe2\x80\x99s why Sanders kept talking about Henry Kissinger, Alex Shephard explained.Clinton wants you to believe she is Barack Obama, Rebecca Leber wrote.Clinton tried to smother Sanders with agreement, Jeet Heer observed.She was also trying to hold a referendum on the Obama era, Laura Reston argued.They both talked around systematic racism, Heer said.Clinton and Sanders sparred over deporting immigrant children, Steven Cohen wrote.The debate did have the chillest vibe of this entire primary, Elizabeth Bruenig noted.But it was an audiophile\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare, Shephard complained.The candidates were often in \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryu Spaeth said.Bernie Sanders found his \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re likable enough, Hillary,\xe2\x80\x9d Shephard noted.You know you\xe2\x80\x99re at a new stage of the Democratic primary when race gets brought up unsolicited, Steven Cohen observed.\xc2\xa0In a first, Leber wrote, Sanders was the token man at the otherwise all-female debate.Elspeth Reeve12 hours agoPBSBernie killed it on the final debate question and Hillary... didn\xe2\x80\x99t.PBS elevated this question from a random Facebook person: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you name two leaders, one American and one foreign, who would influence your policy decisions?\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders could have trolled all of conservative media by answering \xe2\x80\x9cNeville Chamberlain.\xe2\x80\x9d He didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that, but he also did more than name uncontroversial dead presidents. His answer was inspiring, a case against defeatism.Franklin Delano Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s famous line\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing we have to fear is fear itself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9ca profound statement that gave the American people the courage to believe that, yes, we could get out of that terrible Depression. And then what he did is redefine the role of government.\xe2\x80\x9d Herbert Hoover had argued helping needy people was not the role of the government. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what FDR said was, \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, it is.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders then shifted to a pitch for his candidacy, and a defense against Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s criticism that his policies are not achievable: \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I see our campaign is about, right now, in this particular moment of serious crisis, saying to the American people, \xe2\x80\x98Dont give up on the political process. \xc2\xa0... If we engage and get involved, yeah, we can have health care for all people,\xe2\x80\x9d and free college tuition, etc. Then he cited Winston Churchill, though \xe2\x80\x9c[his]\xc2\xa0politics were not my politics,\xe2\x80\x9d for rallying the British people.His answer ended on a pleasant, patriotic note, just as the debate was almost over. Hillary began her response by clearing her throat, which was not a good sign. She said FDR was great, but she also liked Nelson Mandela \xe2\x80\x9cfor his generosity of heart, for his understanding of the need for reconciliation.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s it. Then she started attacking Sanders for criticizing President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s leadership.\xc2\xa0Clinton did get applause when she said Obama \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the credit he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d But it was still tone-deaf, taking a moment that was about America being awesome and turning it into a fight over cable news hits. And it underscored the memes of the campaign\xe2\x80\x94that Sanders has inspiring ideas, and that Clinton knows how to score points.Steven Cohen12 hours agoClinton and Sanders spar over deporting immigrant children. Both the Democratic candidates have come out in support of comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship. But Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s debate exposed a clear difference in immigration policy.In a combative exchange, Bernie Sanders reiterated his refusal to deport children to the \xe2\x80\x9chorrendously violent areas of Honduras and neighboring countries\xe2\x80\x9d they are now fleeing in record numbers. Clinton, on the other hand, said that while she was against the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinhumane\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0deportation raids, she would not come out against child deportation in general, preferring instead to back a proposal currently being put forward in Congress to provide undocumented minors guaranteed legal services, a right they do not currently enjoy.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe should be deporting criminals, not hard-working immigrant families,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\xc2\xa0What\xe2\x80\x99s striking about her response is not simply the willingness to ship children back to a region mired in conflict-level bloodshed. It\xe2\x80\x99s her insistence on sticking to the very tough-on crime pose that helped foster the present situation in the first place. Especially in El Salvador, today\xe2\x80\x99s gang violence directly stems\xc2\xa0from the Clinton-era policy of aggressively deporting felons.Rebecca Leber12 hours agoHillary Clinton wants you to believe she is Barack Obama. Clinton kept tying herself to the president throughout Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic debate. She had nothing but praise for Obama and scorn for Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of him.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think he gets the credit he deserves,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said of Obama, citing his handling of the financial crisis and Republican obstructionism. Clinton accused Sanders of calling Obama weak and disappointing.\xc2\xa0Of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s because\xc2\xa0Obama polls at an average\xc2\xa087 percent\xc2\xa0among Democratic voters nationwide. In the next primary, South Carolina, Obama receives 93 percent approval among registered Democrats, according to a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal\xc2\xa0poll.On health care she noted, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a staunch supporter of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s principal accomplishment,\xe2\x80\x9d the Affordable Care Act. On systemic racism:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI think President Obama has set a great example.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0She also commended his approach to the influx of undocumented children entering the U.S.:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that there was a great effort made by the Obama administration and others to really send a clear message.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Sanders took issue with Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s characterizations, because he too is well aware\xc2\xa0of the president\xe2\x80\x99s popularity.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cI have been a strong ally with him on virtually every issue,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders replied. Earlier in the debate,\xc2\xa0Sanders said he is \xe2\x80\x9csomebody who is very fond of the president,\xc2\xa0agrees with him most of the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Alex Shephard13 hours agoJewel Samad/GettyThis is why Bernie Sanders keeps talking about Henry Kissinger.In the foreign policy section of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic debate, Sanders has\xc2\xa0sounded a bit like my AP U.S. History teacher, who was cool as hell and introduced me to Howard Zinn and the Grateful Dead.\xc2\xa0He\xe2\x80\x99s talked about\xc2\xa0Mosaddegh, the democratically elected Iranian leader that the United States overthrew in 1953. And he\xe2\x80\x99s talked a lot about Henry Kissinger.\xc2\xa0Sanders may have exaggerated some of the negative consequences of some of Kissinger\xe2\x80\x99s actions and policies\xe2\x80\x94the idea that the opening to China was bad because it cost American jobs seems like an overstatement. But he\xe2\x80\x99s totally right to call Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Kissinger into question, as his foreign policy was disastrous and led to incredibly destructive consequences around the world, from Chile to Cambodia. (For more on the relationship between Clinton and Kissinger, this story is a good place to start.)\xc2\xa0Sanders has struggled to articulate a core foreign policy throughout the campaign. Though he\xe2\x80\x99s made small strides, it\xe2\x80\x99s clear that he still isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly comfortable venturing out on his own. So he\xe2\x80\x99s sticking to his core message, which is that Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy judgment has led to disastrous, unforeseen consequences. And her relationship with Kissinger is a proxy for that argument.Jeet Heer13 hours agoClinton is trying to smother Sanders with agreement. David Axelrod, who ran Obama\xe2\x80\x99s winning presidential campaign in 2008, made a shrewd observation on Twitter:Even when @SenSanders was clearly looking to start a fight, @hillaryclinton chose to hug not slug. All stiletto tonight. #DemDebate\xe2\x80\x94 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 12, 2016\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right that as the underdog and challenger, Sanders is trying to differentiate himself from Clinton, to give people a reason to vote for him. Clinton, by contrast, is trying to suggest that she and Sanders agree on goals, but she\xe2\x80\x99s more adept at achieving those goals. Clinton also doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to attack Sanders directly because she has many more surrogates in the party who will do that for her.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in vigorous agreement here,\xe2\x80\x9d Clinton said at one point. When Sanders suggested he and Clinton differed on expanding Social Security, Clinton responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s fair to say we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d After outlining her policy of focusing on low-income seniors, she ended by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no disagreement about the need to buttress Social Security, get more revenue into the program. ...I think we\xe2\x80\x99re in vigorous agreement here. ...We\xe2\x80\x99re going to end up in the same place.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0Sanders might have tried to provoke an argument, but Clinton was set on extinguishing his attempt to seem like an alternative.\xc2\xa0Laura Reston13 hours agoPBSHillary is trying to turn this election into a referendum on the Obama era.Clinton\nhas dodged every chance to criticize the president in this debate. Asked what\nshe could do for the black community that President Obama has not, she\nrejected the question outright. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are seeing the\ndark side of the remaining systemic racism that we have to root out in our\nsociety,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think what President Obama did was to exemplify\nthe importance of this issue.\xe2\x80\x9dAsked whether racial issues would improve under a Sanders administration, the Vermont senator responded: \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely.\xe2\x80\x9dThe\nexchange illuminated a central divide between the candidates. Hillary has yoked herself to the president. She often talks about her experience in his cabinet\nand is now airing ads in South Carolina that feature Obama appointee Eric Holder giving her\nhis endorsement. Meanwhile, Sanders has argued for sweeping aside many Obama-era reforms. \xc2\xa0Framing\nthis race as a referendum on the Obama years may help Clinton among black voters, particularly in South Carolina. Still loyal to the\npresident, they may not want to junk his reforms in a sweeping Sanders \xe2\x80\x9crevolution.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0FacebookInstagramTwitterCopyright 2016 \xc2\xa9 New Republic.

There was some speculation that she would hit Sanders hard at Thursday night\\u2019s debate, to blunt his momentum following an overwhelming victory in New Hampshire. And earlier in the day we got a glimpse of the kinds of cutting attacks her campaign can deploy, with supporter John Lewis coldly excising Sanders from any involvement in the civil rights movement.But as in 2008, when her attacks on the broadly liked Barack Obama fell flat, going negative on Sanders has only served to alienate liberals that Clinton ultimately needs to convince. It seems Clinton finally understands this; in the debate last night she insistently highlighted her areas of agreement with Sanders, lauded the ambitions of the progressive movement, and stuck close to Obama, the most unifying figure in the party.
