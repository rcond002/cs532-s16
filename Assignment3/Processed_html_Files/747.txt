Depending on whether you\'re upgrading from 2010 or 2013, this version of OneNote will seem familiar, or totally new. Here\'s a list of what\'s new:\n\n\nUpgrading from 2013\nIf you\'re upgrading to OneNote 2016 from OneNote 2013, you\'ll still have all the features you\'re used to\xe2\x80\x94and you\'ll notice a few new ones as well. The first thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll see when you open OneNote 2016 is that it has the familiar look of 2013 with a more colorful border. You\'ll be able to take advantage of OneNote integration with other apps and services too.\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you\'re working on a Windows 10 computer and notice two versions of OneNote, you can read about   the difference between OneNote and OneNote 2016.\n\nInsert videos into a page\nYou can now embed videos from Office Mix, Vimeo and YouTube into a page in OneNote. For more about how to do this, see Insert online videos into OneNote.\n\n\nTake notes right on the web\nWith Microsoft Edge, the new browser for Windows 10, you can write on the web. After you take notes, or highlight on a webpage, you can share your handiwork to OneNote. Learn more at the Windows How-to site.\n\n\nSend notes to yourself in email\nWith me@onenote.com, you can send content from your inbox right to OneNote.\r\n\r\nSending email to OneNote is a great way to store important content so you can find it quickly later. If you\xe2\x80\x99re on the go and want to send yourself a reminder, just write a  quick mail. Or, if you\xe2\x80\x99re using an app with an "Email this" button, you can share it with yourself in email.\n\n\nClip the web with Clipper\n\n\n\nOneNote Clipper is another way to clip the web right to OneNote. When you open Clipper, you can choose to clip an entire page or just part of one. You can even choose what notebook and section to clip it to\xe2\x80\x94so you\'ll know where to find it later. Clipper is a free app that you can get from onenote.com/clipper. Clipper sits on your browser\'s Favorites bar so it\'s at your fingertips when you need it.\n\n\nCapture images on your phone with Office Lens\nOffice Lens is a phone app. It\'s a great way to capture notes and info from whiteboards, menus, signs, or anything with a lot of text. You don\'t need to jot down notes, rely on blurry pictures, or worry about misplacing your notes. It\xe2\x80\x99s great for capturing sketches, drawings, and equations too, and even images without text.\r\n\r\nOffice Lens gets rid of shadows and odd angles so images are easier to read. You can download Office Lens for free from the Windows Phone Store.\r\nDon\'t have a Windows Phone? No worries! Office Lens is available for iPhone\r\nand Android too.\n\n\n \n\nUpgrading from 2010\nIf you\'re upgrading to OneNote 2016 from 2010, you\'ll enjoy all the features listed above, and you\'ll find a host of other new features that were introduced in 2013. OneNote has a clean and simple look so you can focus on your notes, and not the user interface. Aside from visuals, you\'ll have lots of useful features too.\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you\'re working on a Windows 10 computer and notice two versions of OneNote, you can read about   the difference between OneNote and OneNote 2016.\n\nSave and share files in the cloud\n\n\n\nThe cloud is your file storage in the sky. In OneNote, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to create a notebook on OneDrive or to your organization\xe2\x80\x99s site. From there, you can easily view, edit, sync, and share your notes and even work together with family members, colleagues, or classmates on the same notes at the same time. Is your notebook on your hard drive? You can move it to the cloud anytime.\n\n\nSync notes across computers and devices\n\n\n\nWhen you store your notebooks in the cloud, you can get to your notes on all your devices\xe2\x80\x94including your Windows computer or tablets, Mac, smart phone, iPad or Android device. You can also use the free Office Online in virtually any browser.\n\n\nDraw, sketch, or handwrite notes\nSmoothly draw, erase, and edit with your finger, stylus, or mouse on any touch-capable device, such as a Tablet PC or laptop with touch screen. If you need to share your handwritten notes and care about legibility, OneNote can automatically convert your handwriting to text.\n\nTop of Page\n\n\n\nEmbed Excel spreadsheets and Visio diagrams\nYou can attach just about any computer file to any part of your notes, so you have a copy of the file in your notebook. You can also create or import Excel spreadsheets and Visio diagrams right within OneNote and edit their information in place in your notes.\n\n\nMake better tables\nCreate more sophisticated tables in your notes than ever before. OneNote now supports new formatting options for cell shading, header rows, and data sorting within table cells so you can organize and display information the way you want to.\n\nTop of Page\n\n\n\nSee who\xe2\x80\x99s collaborating\nIdentify and authenticate other authors more easily with the integrated identity profiles in OneNote. Search for notebook changes and revisions by authors\xe2\x80\x99 names and view all recent edits when you return to a shared notebook.\n\n\nShare notes in meetings\nJoin online meetings and share your notes from any supported device, even if Office isn\xe2\x80\x99t installed.\n\n\nSave, search, and share everything\nOneNote automatically saves and syncs everything while you work, so you can concentrate on your thoughts and ideas instead of your files. Use Instant Search to find anything you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever created or saved in OneNote. And if you ever need to share a snapshot of your notes with someone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have OneNote, you can export your files in a variety of file formats.\n\nTop of Page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies To: OneNote 2016\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\xef\xbb\xbf\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nHow can we improve it?\n255 characters remaining\n\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include contact information in your feedback.
