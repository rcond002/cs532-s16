Boosted by guest appearances from Rick Ross, Yo Gotti, Quentin Miller, Young Thug and more, Trae recruits one of his frequent producers and engineers, Watson the Great, for the musical backdrop here. The 35-year-old rhymer aims to gain the respect of rap critics and fans once again with Tha Truth Part 2.\nXXL recently sat down with Trae tha Truth to discuss the new album, his hard work ethic, the best advice he\xe2\x80\x99s received from T.I. and this year\xe2\x80\x99s Trae Day event in Houston.\nXXL: How long did it take you to record your latest project, Tha Truth, Pt. 2?\nTrae tha Truth: Originally, Tha Truth Part 1 was a double CD. I was talked out of doing the double CD so the majority of it was done when I finished the first part. I was able to go in the studio and put some finishing touches with my engineer, Watson the Great and I think I added two or three more songs to the project.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the difference then between last year\xe2\x80\x99s Tha Truth and the one dropping this year? \nMe, personally, I thought it was a tad more darker and personal. And then at first, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how people would react to it but everybody to this present time who have heard the album love part one and felt that part one couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be outdone, but after they continue to part two, they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be amazed and they\xe2\x80\x99ll love part two as well.\nHow did you end up linking with Quentin Miller for your single \xe2\x80\x9cTakers\xe2\x80\x9d?\nWe were in the studio and that record that we made wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even for the album because we were just doing records. It was just the vibe, you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying. The vibe of the record fit and I felt like I was missing that on the album because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot more seriousness and other type records but as far just that young, just don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn, feel-good record, we needed that for the album.\nListen to Trae tha Truth\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cTakers\xe2\x80\x9d Feat. Quentin Miller\nSubscribe to XXL on \nDid you face any challenges during the recording process of the album? \nWhen it comes to music, I never face challenges. I tell people all the time when I do my music it\xe2\x80\x99s just me venting. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going in there to make a certain type of record, or make a certain song, or catch up with a fad that everyone is doing. I just go in there and do me. Music probably be the least of my problems.\nWho are some of the producers and artists featured on this Tha Truth Pt. 2? \nI\xe2\x80\x99m proud to say my engineer we built a lot together, Watson the Great, he\xe2\x80\x99s on over half the album. Feature-wise, you know I got T.I., Rick Ross, Yo Gotti, the homie Price from Audio Push, Young Thug, Quentin Miller, Kid Ink and Liz Rodriguez. I got a different variety on this project.\nTalk to me about the chemistry between you and Watson the Great?\nHe knows my sound very well. Any two ways I record it has to be sent to him to let him touch it, you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying, because he knows how it supposed to sound and how I sound on a record. Sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s to the point where I can do something and I put all my trust on him because I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be handled the correct way, the way I want it to sound. We come together really good when it comes to music. We make that music that can be felt for real. for real.\nDo you feel like you give away too much music for free? \nThat\xe2\x80\x99s what J. Cole made me understand. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get it at first, I can honestly say I do now. People take an album way more serious than a mixtape, always. I felt like all my mixtapes worth are like albums, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there was much difference, but I seen the reaction from when I first started campaigning for Tha Truth Part 1 all the way up to now. People take it a lot more serious. You gotta think about it, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really doing interviews with y\xe2\x80\x99all when it was time for mixtapes, but when it comes time for an album, we\xe2\x80\x99re working.\nHow many songs recorded do you think your have in your stash? \nI have over 1,700 songs hidden away. I have four hard drives just sitting up at Tree Sound studios. I kind of have that \xe2\x80\x98Pac ethic. Just work, work, work and work. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good thing, you know what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying? The bad thing is people feel I hold on to way too much music lately.\nTalk to me about this year\xe2\x80\x99s Trae Day and how the special day came about? \nIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be on July 22 this year. I got the day from the mayor. It was a day to celebrate me for lots of stuff that I do in the community but instead of celebrating for me, I wanted to make it a day for the city where I can do everything and anything I can for them. So I made a celebration for all of us you know, instead of taking the time to put the light on me and it turned out to be amazing.\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s been the piece of advice you\xe2\x80\x99ve received from T.I.?\nThink, because I can move off anger in a blast of a second. He can calm me down sometimes to the point I\xe2\x80\x99ll be pissed like, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, the fuck am I on the phone with you?\xe2\x80\x9d because he can talk me out of it and I want to be pissed off right now. I get it. I understand.\nWhat else should fans expect from you this year? \nTha Truth Part 2 in February, followed by another album after that. You know I have my cartoon on Fuse right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s part of a show called Explicit Language. Hopefully, it\xe2\x80\x99ll land a deal with Cartoon Network. Of course, I\xe2\x80\x99m getting ready to shoot my own film when I can finally take a break and just more work. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to do little bit of everything and just keep the work coming.\nSee 40 Hip-Hop Albums Turning 20 in 2016\n\n\twindow.TSM = window.TSM || {};\n\twindow.TSM.photogalleryConfigs = window.TSM.photogalleryConfigs || [];\n\tvar photogalleryConfig = {\n\t\tgalleryUrl:\'/api/json/galleries/545899?filterexclusions&galleryindex=0\'\n\t\t,galleryId:\'tsm-photogallery-812-545899-0\'\n\t\t,showThumbs:0\n\t\t,colorscheme:\'dark\'\n\t\t\n\t\t,dozIndexTweak:1\n\t\t,refreshRate:1\n\t\t,enableFullscreen:1\n\t\t,expandOnLoadHash:0\n\t\t,portraitMode:0\n\t\t,initImage:\'http://www.xxlmag.com/files/2016/01/Fugees-Ghostface-2Pac.jpg\'\n\t};\n\twindow.TSM.photogalleryConfigs.push( photogalleryConfig );\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage  of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under: Feature | Trae Tha Truth Category: News \n\n\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\n\nREDDIT\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\n\nPrint this page\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tfunction TSMTrackGPlus(data){\n\t\t\t\tvar gaPrimaryAccount = \'\';\n\t\t\t\tif(typeof window.TSM !== undefined) {\n\t\t\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgaPrimaryAccount = window.TSM.ga.accounts[0];\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tcatch(err){\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow \'primary google analytics account not found\';\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tif(data.state=="on"){\n\t\t\t\t\tif( _gaq !== undefined && gaPrimaryAccount !== \'\'){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_gaq.push(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[ \'_setAccount\', gaPrimaryAccount ],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'_trackEvent\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'social\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'Gplus\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata.href\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}else if(data.state=="off"){\n\t\t\t\t\tif( _gaq !== undefined && gaPrimaryAccount !== \'\'){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_gaq.push(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[ \'_setAccount\', gaPrimaryAccount ],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'_trackEvent\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'social\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'Gminus\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata.href\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t(function() {\n\t\t\t\tif(!document.getElementById(\'google-plus-loaded\')){\n\t\t\t\t\tvar po = document.createElement(\'script\');
