responsibility to customer and employee engagement - The Peer Awards bangs the drum for good ideas. We take a look at some of the great things those shortlisted have been doing \n\n\nInspirational ideas are worth celebrating. Businesses all over the world are \ncoming up with innovative ways to improve community and boost customer and \nemployee engagement. The Peer Awards \ngives these ideas a platform, encouraging professionals from different \norganisations to celebrate the ideas of others, while sharing their own. \n\nThe Peer Awards have shortlisted the most creative ideas submitted. These \nfinalists present their initiatives at the Peer Awards Conference on 18 \nJune, where everyone attending has their chance to vote, including the \nfinalists themselves. Winners will be announced at a sumptuous afternoon tea Awards \nCeremony at London\xe2\x80\x99s Waldorf Hilton on 25 September.\n\n\nHere are some of the great things the finalists are up to\n\nCorporate Responsibility (CSR)\n\nIn terms of CSR, there is a lot of great work being done by big and small \nbusiness alike. For example Sky is doing good works in a number of \ncategories. Sky Rainforest Rescue is helping save one billion trees in the \nAmazon and generating an increased awareness of deforestation, while Sky \nAcademy is using the power of TV, creativity and sport to help young people \nunlock their potential. \n\nWorking with young people is a theme which occurs regularly. MetLife\xe2\x80\x99s \nLifeChanger initiative sends volunteers into schools to build children\xe2\x80\x99s \nunderstanding of basic financial concepts. Experian\xe2\x80\x99s Values, Money and Me \nprogramme helps primary schools in financially disadvantaged areas to be \ntransformed into Centres of Excellence in financial education. \n\nMeanwhile, Cisco provides a week long work experience programme for year 10/11 \nstudents. With welcome and introduction to Cisco, group sessions, Dragons\xe2\x80\x99 \nDen style activity and soft skills development. IMPA ACT is establishing \nresponsible supply chain management across the shipping industry. \n\nCustomer Engagement\n\nIncreasingly companies are recognising the importance to their business of \nputting the customer centre-stage. Brewing company Molson Coors\xe2\x80\x99 UK business \ncame up with Customers Inc., cardboard cutouts placed around the building \ndesigned to represent 13 customer types and remind employees to keep their \ncustomers in mind. \n\nOver a thousand Tesco.com delivery drivers are, through working with team \nmotivation consultancy, NKD, becoming emotionally connected to delivering \ntheir best service to customers. \n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nKeeping employees enthused and engaged is also becoming a priority for firms. \nThomson Reuters\xe2\x80\x99 Learning Passport is a campaign-based approach, using fun \nand competition to help with learning and development. Meanwhile, Global \nPayments\xe2\x80\x99 Living Our Culture was launched at a special event with the aim of \nimproving communication with integrity. \n\nCisco\xe2\x80\x99s Be Amazing Programme has created activities around innovation, \nbuilding community, developing people, celebrating together, inspiring \npeople and generally making people proud to work at the company, because \npeople that are passionate about working for them and feel it\xe2\x80\x99s a great \nplace to work are good for Cisco. \n\nMetLife\xe2\x80\x99s OneVoice features an innovative internal YouTube-style platform for \ncapturing and sharing employee-generated videos. All OMV\xe2\x80\x99s 25,500 employees \nhave the opportunity to get actively involved in implementing sustainability \nprojects. \n\nEven non-customer-facing Molson Coors\xe2\x80\x99 employees are engaged with customers\xe2\x80\x99 \nneeds thanks to \xe2\x80\x98Customers Inc.\xe2\x80\x99.

Readers Offers \ndoes this by conveying how much individuals are valued as employees and \nLansons by championing women and focusing on female talent. \n\nOthers find that a different approach to training is paying dividends. \nEversheds finds that a flexible approach to coaching achieves much more than \ntraining. The AA has adopted a strengths-based approach to attract and \ndevelop driving instructor talent and Carewatch finds that a collaborative \ntechnique is proving very effective, with managers becoming involved in \nmentoring. \n\nFocus on British Gas \n\nBritish Gas\xe2\x80\x99s Community \nAction Partnership (CAP) is a \xc2\xa31.2m, two-year programme with fuel \npoverty charity National Energy Action. It tackles fuel poverty through a \ntailored partnership approach in eight localities across Britain, positively \naffecting 800,000 people. \n\nCAP works in three ways: \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Supporting local authorities to develop and implement their fuel poverty \nstrategies. It has worked with 18 local authorities and reached over 77,000 \npeople to date. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Training community workers to better identify signs of fuel poverty and \nprovide practical assistance to people struggling with bills. It has trained \nmore than 250 advisors so far \xe2\x80\x93 nearly 1,300 trained advisors will go on to \nassist over 37,000 people per year. \n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Engaging consumers in energy efficiency, money management and behaviour \nchange, helping them save money while keeping warm. Over 650 people to date \nhave learnt how to save energy and keep warm, through interactive games and \nquizzes at friendly community events. \n\n\n\n\nBritish Gas\xe2\x80\x99 community initiatives are not just about tackling fuel poverty. \nIn 2014, the British Gas Generation \nGreen programme challenged children to think about energy creatively and \nreduce energy use in school. \n\nPrizes worth up to \xc2\xa31m were available, with demonstrable environmental and \neducational benefits to the community. Teachers delivered a bespoke energy \neducation lesson plan and using this new knowledge, children designed an \neco-house. Their ideas included windmills in gardens and a pavement to \ngenerate electricity. \n\nFrom 500 entries, four schools were chosen as finalists. A dance teacher \nhelped the schools create a routine performed on a power generating dance \nfloor. The winners were judged by members of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Got Talent dance \ntroupe, Diversity. The event happened at Westfield Shopping Centre on a \nstand, which included a path of energy milestones through the ages. The \nwalkway led to an Energy Pledge Tree, where people made a commitment to be \nsustainable. The dancing didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop when the schools left as shoppers \nlearnt about how to manage their energy consumption in a fun and innovative \nway. \n\nThe winners were given an energy makeover by British Gas, including the latest \nsustainable technology. These schools are saving around \xc2\xa37,000 a year on \nbills as a result of the makeover and are more energy efficient, saving \n400ktonnes of carbon every year. \n\nThrough this competition, British Gas is creating better schools and children \nwho\xe2\x80\x99ll be inspired to be energy innovators of the future. This is hopefully \nencouraging better habits and leading to lasting changes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\ntto.config = tto.config || {};\ntto.config.commenting = {\nid : "tto4467303", // Article id \nurl : "http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/thepeerawards/article4467303.ece", // Article url\ntitle : "The 2015 Peer Awards: Celebrating the inspirational in business", // Article title\narticleToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJuZXdzaW50IiwidGl0bGUiOiJUaGUgMjAxNSBQZWVyIEF3YXJkczogQ2VsZWJyYXRpbmcgdGhlIGluc3BpcmF0aW9uYWwgaW4gYnVzaW5lc3MiLCJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnRoZXRpbWVzLmNvLnVrL3R0by9wdWJsaWMvdGhlcGVlcmF3YXJkcy9hcnRpY2xlNDQ2NzMwMy5lY2UiLCJ0YWdzIjoidHRvIiwiY2hlY2tzdW0iOiI3NTEwODE1ZWE2ZmExY2IxMTU1MDQ4YmY0ODU5M2M3MyIsImFydGljbGVJZCI6InR0bzQ0NjczMDMifQ.H4Bc8BeU91X3_HU55Gswm2W2vOre3khgvhi5mGfvsOE",\nchecksum : "7510815ea6fa1cb1155048bf48593c73", // Checksum of Metadata\nmyAccountUrl : "https://home.thetimes.co.uk" // URL to authenticate user\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSponsored Editorial\n\n\n\n\n\nScrum Together\nWin a visit from a home nations\xe2\x80\x99 hero to your local club\nLet us know your moment of teamwork and a Six Nations rugby star could join you for the day\n\n\n\n\n\nVisit the USA\nOld-style charm in Charleston\nA hotspot for modern art and culture where elegance is never out of fashion\n\n\n\n\n\nAfrica Travel\nSafaris, cities and luxurious beach getaways\nThere is no time like the present to make South Africa your holiday destination of choice\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Challengers\nDare to be different\nMeet the businesses shaking up the status quo\n\n\n\n\n\nInsight\nNew year - new view\nAs thoughts turn to fresh starts and healthier living, put some focus on your eyes in 2016\n\n\n\n\n\nThe future of engineering \nTake the fear factor out of innovation\nHow cultural resistance to change must be overcome if companies want to move ahead\n\n\n\n\n\nCyber Security\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t kiss goodbye to online safety\nHow to educate employees about protecting their data from hackers\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilips Airfryer\nA healthier diet starts here\nFree 32-recipe Airfryer cookbook - to make indulging in our favourite foods a guilt-free pleasure\n\n\n\n\n\nReady Business Mentor\nRevealing the five entrepreneurs to be guided by business guru Sophie Cornish \n\n\n\n\n\n\nCity Business\nGetting started\nThinking of setting up a business abroad?
