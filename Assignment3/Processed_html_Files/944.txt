Since the global financial crisis, however, European businesses and especially SMEs have been caught in a cruel catch-22 trap.\nTraditionally more reliant on bank loans than market-based finance compared with their American counterparts, many companies have struggled to access finance as the banks sought to restore their balance sheets to meet tighter regulations brought in following the financial crisis.\nBrussels is now looking to bridge the gap with a series of initiatives designed to kickstart lending to SMEs.  It\xe2\x80\x99s Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (COSME) initiative has a budget of over \xe2\x82\xac1.3billion (\xc2\xa3940 million) to fund these financial instruments that facilitate access to loans and equity finance for SMEs where market gaps have been identified.\nPart of the COSME budget, which runs until 2020, will fund guarantees and counter-guarantees for financial intermediaries, such as banks and leasing companies, to help them provide more loan and lease finance to SMEs.  Its most significant intervention was the unveiling of an action plan in September this year to help build a true capital markets union (CMU) across all 28 EU states.  The key elements are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\tLegislation to establish a framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation\n\xe2\x80\xa2\tChanges to the Solvency II rules to make it easier for insurers to invest in infrastructure and European Long Term Investment Funds\n\xe2\x80\xa2\tConsultation on whether changes to the venture capital regulations could boost the take-up of these funds\n\xe2\x80\xa2\tReview of the Prospectus Directive to reduce barriers to smaller firms listing on markets\n\xe2\x80\xa2\tGreen Paper on retail financial services to boost consumer choice and competition in cross border retail financial services and insurance\nLord (Jonathan) Hill, the EU Commissioner whose remit includes capital markets union, said in October that CMU was essential to deliver deeper capital markets to complement bank lending and support European growth. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will look at how to remove barriers to small firms raising money from capital markets, and how we can better connect information on investment opportunities in SMEs to investors the world over,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nThanks to banking union, European banks have been able to invest cross border, but individuals and small businesses have found national legislation means it is hard to move money between different countries.\nChristian Odendahl, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform, gives the example of an investor in London looking to put money in a Czech start-up finding issues such as the prospectus document, tax treatment and insolvency regime are all matters of national competence.\nIt is exactly these issues that have proved the hardest nuts to crack.  Graham Bishop, a former City economist and consultant on EU integration, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOther commissioners have already picked the low hanging fruit, so Commissioner Hill has been left with the nettles to grasp.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe welcomed the move to consult on the various insolvency and restructuring regimes across the EU and come forward with a legislative plan by 2016.  \xe2\x80\x9cThey have to do this because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they\xe2\x80\x99re not serious.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOdendahl agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cMost of the steps they plan to take make a lot of sense, such as the modernisation of the prospectus directive to help smaller businesses take part in capital markets, or to revise the regulatory treatment of infrastructure investment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nHill faced two choices.  Once was to mimic the strategy with banking union when the Commission put the powerful institution of the European Central Bank in charge.  However, that would have involved driving through harmonisation of national regulation at a time when member states were struggling to deal with the refugee crisis and negotiations ahead of the UK referendum on EU membership.\nThe alternative was to take a step-by-step approach to tackling the individual barriers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of constraints holding back a properly unified capital market,\xe2\x80\x9d Odendahl said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cHill has looked at what are the most binding constraints on cross-border capital flows, and where Europe can achieve the most bang for the buck, given that banking union-type full integration is not on the cards.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe question is how much we can achieve with small steps in terms of convergence in how we treat capital market products and make sure investors in, say, London have enough confidence in a capital market of another country.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf the process leads to simpler and better regulation, it could benefit supporters of a yes vote in the referendum. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople who understand capital markets will see that as a good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Odendahl said.  \xe2\x80\x9cBeing successful on an issue like capital markets union is a positive for the \xe2\x80\x98In\xe2\x80\x99 campaign.  It is certainly not something that the \xe2\x80\x98out\xe2\x80\x99 campaign will point to as a bad thing for Britain.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nIf the process leads to simpler and better regulation, it could benefit supporters of a yes vote in the referendum.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Feature\n\nComment &amp; Analysis\nJim Esposito\nGlobal Co-Head of Financing Group\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\n\nFree markets bring all-round benefits\n\r\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s institutional capital markets play a central role in allocating funds between investors who provide capital and companies who consume capital.  The more efficient and free these markets, the greater the benefits to each side. Greater efficiency means cheaper capital for companies to grow and a broader more diversified array of assets for investors to deploy their capital.\n\r\nGreater efficiency is driven by greater competition, and companies benefit hugely from being able to choose between accessing the bond and institutional loan markets or their traditional bank.  Securitisation can boost traditional lending by enabling new challenger banks and speciality finance platforms, and by providing an additional source of funding and risk sharing to traditional banks.\n\r\nSubstantial reforms have been made to the financial services industry globally, with banks becoming more strongly capitalised.  These reforms have impacted credit supply to European borrowers from traditional banks.  Institutional capital markets are able to not only replace this source of credit, but they can often represent cheaper options, with fewer restrictions.\n\r\nGiven the recent maturation of the European debt capital markets, companies are increasingly confident that they can complement the traditional banking relationships by accessing the institutional capital markets.\n\r\nPotentially the most important users of capital in Europe today are those companies that need to invest in growth. Their success can be enhanced by access to diversified sources of capital beyond the traditional commercial banks.  Many of these companies, however, are rated below investment grade given their size.  Changes in regulation could unlock incremental capital for these companies. Regulatory changes that provide greater freedom to investors, combined with changes to legal frameworks that deal with bankruptcy and insolvency, would help companies and investors alike.\n\r\nTake infrastructure, a sector that provides benefits to towns, cities and national economies.  The increased focus on levels of public debt across Europe meant that investment in infrastructure has suffered.  This is often considered one reason for the reduced long term growth rate.  Broader institutional investment can provide an effective solution by supplementing both public institutions and traditional commercial banking in this critical sector.\nThis content was produced by the Advertising Department of The Times in collaboration with Goldman Sachs.

This does include crowdfunding in all its forms (see last\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n Alternative finance is often equated with peer-to-peer lending and other types of crowdfunding but there is more to it than that, according to Bryan Zhang, a director of Judge Business School\xe2\x80\x99s Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is any form of financial channels and instruments that have emerged outside the traditional financial system,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. This does include crowdfunding in all its forms (see last week\xe2\x80\x99s article) but it also covers alternative currencies, such as Bitcoin; online currency exchange platforms; pension-led business funding; online invoice trading; and mini-bonds. Each of the last three can be used for business funding, either to improve cash flow or to access capital for growth.\n\xe2\x80\x9cInvoice trading and pension-led funding are much less well-known in comparison to peer-to-peer lending,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are not more complex or more risky, they are just newer, and there is a smaller market than for other types of alternative finance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nInvoice trading is the best known of these newer tools, probably because banks have offered a similar service for quite some time, said Zhang. The idea is that SMEs sell their unpaid invoices to investors at a discount, meaning that they get their money much faster than waiting for their clients to pay up, improving the business\xe2\x80\x99s cash flow and reducing the amount of time that they need to spend chasing late payers. It is an approach that can prove particularly useful for consultancies and other businesses that sell services rather than products because it is not a loan, and therefore does not require the business to put up stock or property as collateral.\n\xe2\x80\x9cQuite a few (start-ups) use invoice trading because the banks do not get their business model,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zhang. \xe2\x80\x9cOften these are from the knowledge economy \xe2\x80\x93 consultancies, say \xe2\x80\x93 and do not fit the standard borrowing profile. So sometimes banks do not get it but platforms like Market Invoice are fintech companies, and they get it. They know how to evaluate the risk because they have a better understanding of the business model.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOnline invoice trading platforms also offer a service that is cheaper and significantly more flexible than that offered by banks, he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you go to a bank that offers invoice factoring it could take days, weeks or even months (to get your money) but online it would be minutes, or maybe hours.\xe2\x80\x9d It also gives the SME more control, as online platforms let sellers decide which invoices they want to offer up; banks, on the other hand, usually want all or nothing.\nPension-led funding, meanwhile, allows the owners or directors of an SME to tap into a pension fund \xe2\x80\x93 often one accrued while working in a more traditional corporate job before turning entrepreneur \xe2\x80\x93 through a SIPP to invest their money into their own business, said Zhang. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s liberating their pension pot to use for working capital or expansion capital.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not risk-free; it is also bound by the strict regulations that already govern pensions, he added.\nOne alternative finance growth area where regulation is still on the vague side is mini-bonds \xe2\x80\x93 ones issued directly by small companies. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually bonds are very much a corporate thing with some sort of rating behind them as a lending instrument offered to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d said Norbert Morawetz, a lecturer in entrepreneurship at Henley Business School. \xe2\x80\x9cWith mini-bonds, companies offer structured loans (directly) to the public. In other words they are disintermediating.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor investors and SMEs alike it is a market that \xe2\x80\x9crequires a bit more savvy\xe2\x80\x9d but gives the borrower more flexibility that is possible using a peer-lending platform. \xe2\x80\x9cWith bonds (the borrower) has more control and can set their own rate and offer longer-term premiums than a platform would. And typically with bonds you can also trade them and sell them on, although I have not seen that yet. That (would) create a different alternative finance market to trade these bonds on,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.\nMorawetz is curious to see whether such a secondary market will emerge \xe2\x80\x93 and indeed to find out which directions fintechs will take alternative finance next. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at alternative finance now, it has replicated and innovated on what traditional banking used to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have made it more efficient in some ways, for instance with the use of algorithms and big data. Beyond that it will be interesting to see what the new innovations will be. In some ways the big opportunities, the easy targets, have been addressed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        VIDEO\n                                    \nThe potential benefits of CMU\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nJim Esposito, co-head of the Global Financing Group at Goldman Sachs, and Craig Calhoun, professor and director at the London School of Economics and Political Science, lead a conversation on creating an EU Capital Markets Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jim Esposito, co-head of the Global Financing Group at Goldman Sachs, and Craig Calhoun, professor and director at the London School of Economics and Political Science, lead a conversation on creating an EU Capital Markets Union.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent provided by Goldman Sachs.

They are an important source of equity for small firms with growth potential in their early stages of development, long before they become attractive for venture capital funds. They provide not only financing but business experience that is vital for start-ups. Angel investment in Europe increased to \xe2\x82\xac5.5 billion in 2013, a growth of 8.7 per cent from 2012, remaining the main financier of European start-ups.\n\n\nMain areas of European early stage Investment, \xe2\x82\xacm\n\n\n\nSource: EBAN (European Trade Association for Business Angels, Deed Funds and Other Early Stage Market Players)\n\n\n\n\n\nBusinessAngels\n\n\n\nNumber of active business angel networks in Europe\n\n\n\nSource: EBAN (European Trade Association for Business Angels, Deed Funds and Other Early Stage Market Players)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrowdfunding(equity)\n\n\n\nThe essence of this form of funding is in the name: accumulating small investments from a large number of individuals.

Lenders buy a bond with a promise to be repaid a certain number of years later. They receive a fixed interest payment known as a coupon. Because corporate bonds are seen as more risky than government bonds such as so-called risk-free US Treasurys, they tend to pay a higher coupon. The bonds can be traded between investors and receive a grade from rating agencies. Bonds issued by start-ups tended to be rated as \xe2\x80\x9cjunk\xe2\x80\x9d. The backing for the bond usually comes from the company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to repay the bond, which is typically money to be earned from future operations. In some cases, the company\xe2\x80\x99s physical assets may be used as collateral for bonds. Most institutional bonds issued by companies have larger minimum investments, effectively ruling them out as individual holdings for household investors. In London retail bonds emerged to fill this gap as they usually require a minimum investment of between \xc2\xa3100 and \xc2\xa31,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorperatebonds\n\n\n\nInternational European Debt Capital Markets Volume\n\nSource: Dealogic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEquity finance\n\n\n\nCompanies can raise money by selling shares in the business.

There are two related techniques that enable businesses to raise short-term funds often for one or two months \xe2\x80\x94 factoring and invoice discounting. With factoring, the financier takes over the job of collecting the money owed which means that the debtor knows that the company has sold on the invoice. With invoice discounting, the financier lends money against your unpaid invoices, which the borrowers remain responsible for collecting.\n\n\nTotal European Invoice Factor Market\n\nSource: A Treasurer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to the Financial Supply Chain, Demica, 2012\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMini-bonds\n\n\n\nMini-bonds are a category of unsecured debts that are not transferable between investors. In other words, once an investor has bought a mini bond, they cannot sell them on but have to retain them until the company buys them back after a fixed period, which is typically after three to five years. The return obtained by investors is in the form of interest, which is paid in cash and often higher than other instruments reflecting higher risk, interest paid in kind (for example, discounts on the company\xe2\x80\x99s products or services) or a mixture of the two. Italy launched a market in mini-bonds in 2012 and a number UK companies have issued mini-bonds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMini-bonds\n\n\n\nPeer-to-peer lending\nPeer-to-peer (P2P) lending, also known as crowdlending or social lending, is a personal loan from one individual or company to another, without the involvement of a bank or other traditional financial intermediary.  P2P lending remains a tiny fraction of overall lending sources for households and SMEs, but one that has been quickly growing.  P2P lending platforms match cash flows from borrowers with those from lenders through internet platforms.\n\n\nPensions funds\nPension-led funding uses directors\' personal, existing pension facilities to raise capital for their business. Funds are released from existing pensions and repaid to the scheme with interest. All funding is repaid via loan payments over a fixed term or lease payments as agreed by the trustees and at an agreed commercial rate. It provides companies an opportunity to fund growth opportunities by using assets locked up in a pension scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivateequity\n\n\n\nPrivate equity firms provide medium to long-term finance in return for an equity stake in unquoted companies with high-growth potential. Because investors\xe2\x80\x99 return depends on the growth and profitability of the business, most private equity investors work with the company as a partner to grow the business. Investors look for high-growth potential businesses to invest in, and are likely to be more hands-on than banks. They can also often bring useful expertise into a business.\nIncremental amount of private equity funding raised\n\nSource: EVCA/ PEREP Analytics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivateplacement\n\n\n\nA private placement is a long-term, typically for five to 12 years, fixed interest debt instrument, issued by a corporate directly to institutional investors, including pension funds and insurance companies. Private placements are suitable for businesses who require long-term, senior debt capital, but who are not ready for the public debt markets. The market is more developed in the United States than Europe. The volume of European private placements is growing while US cross border placements have stagnated. There is a strong market in bilateral loans in Germany privately placed, unlisted and unregistered known as Schuldschein.\nPrivate placements by European corporates\n\nSource: M&amp;G;, Standard &amp; Poor\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritisation\n\n\n\nAlso known as asset-based lending, securitisation is the idea of taking assets such as business revenue streams and using those to back the creation and issuance of tradable securities, such as bonds. A whole business securitisation involves the issue of bonds by a special purpose company, which then lends on the proceeds on a secured basis to the operating company, which holds the business assets. However SME- and asset-based securitisation make up a much smaller share of the overall market compared with mortgage-backed securities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecuritisation\n\n\n\nEuropean SME securitisation by country\n\nOutstanding SME securitisation in selected EU countries, in \xe2\x82\xacbn and per cent of total, 2013\nSource: AFME, SIFMA, Bloomberg, Dealogic, Thomson Reuters, prospectus filings, Fitch Ratings, Moody\xe2\x80\x99s, S&amp;P;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVentureCapital\n\n\n\nVenture Capital funds invest in early stage, high-risk, but high-potential businesses. It is most typically suited for early stage companies that are experiencing high-growth or have potential for high-growth. Venture capitalists tend to exit the company typically after a three- to seven-year investment by selling their shares, either back to the business or to another investor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo grow quickly, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s SMEs must seek alternative funding\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe EU should take its lead from the US, says Phil Thornton in the third feature of a weekly four-part series.\nEurope\xe2\x80\x99s economy is too dependent on bank finance. More than six out of ten small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) across the European Union look to their bank to provide growth capital.\nBank loans and securitised assets  together make up less than 40 per cent of the \xe2\x82\xac1.15\xe2\x80\x8atrillion of outstanding funding for SMEs in the US: the equivalent share in the EU is more than 75 per cent.\nIn the wake of the financial crisis banks have cut lending to restore their capital buffers, so small firms have not been able to find capital markets-based finance in the way that their American cousins can.\nIn 2013 banks cut the amount they lent to SMEs, which are seen as riskier bets, by \xe2\x82\xac232\xe2\x80\x8amillion. And according to   a recent survey by the European Commission, more than a third of SMEs  failed to get the full bank financing  they wanted in the six months to  September 2014.\nNon-banking finance is on the rise. Finance from hedge funds, private equity, pension funds and shadow banks is growing but that is often not suited to SMEs.\nThey are increasingly looking to what is known as alternative finance (alt-fi) and in particular online platform-based funding. Between 2012 and 2014, total alt-fi funding in Europe surged 146 per cent each year, according to a report by the Cambridge Centre   for Alternative Finance (CCAF) at the Judge Business School.\nFunding to consumers, entrepreneurs, creative artists, SMEs, social enterprises, renewable energy projects, community organisations and good causes across the EU rose from \xe2\x82\xac487\xe2\x80\x8amillion in 2012 to \xe2\x82\xac2.96\xe2\x80\x8abillion in 2014 and may have surpassed \xe2\x82\xac7\xe2\x80\x8abillion this year.\nRobert Wardrop, executive director of CCAF, said banks might be under- lending to good borrowers because their credit analytics classified fast growing companies with volatile income streams as too risky. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe these alternative channels are viable and legitimate sources of financing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the market matures, companies that can borrow through bank channels may start to elect to use more alternative channels.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe said the real motive was the speed at which alternative lenders could respond to funding needs, rather than the price. \xe2\x80\x9cSmaller companies don\xe2\x80\x99t work on the basis of what capital they will need in 18 months\xe2\x80\x99 time. When they get an order they need the money now to produce it.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMuch of the success of alt-fi is centred on the UK, which accounted for three quarters of the alternative  finance market during 2012-14, while the 27 remaining  members of the EU contributed 25.7 per cent.\nLast year, UK alt-fi processed \xe2\x82\xac2.33\xe2\x80\x8abillion of deals compared with \xe2\x82\xac154\xe2\x80\x8amillion in Germany, the second placed country. On a per capita basis, that is \xe2\x82\xac36 in the UK and \xe2\x82\xac1.70 in Germany.\nMr Wardrop said a lot came down to the conservative attitudes of   German SMEs, or mittelstand. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are not sure how much they can trust these alternative channels although I think that will change over time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe pointed to Estonia, the second biggest market on a per capita basis financing \xe2\x82\xac16.70 per person, which was the result of having more \xe2\x80\x9cbalanced\xe2\x80\x9d regulation between the interests of  innovation and investor protection.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think the UK and Estonia have done that well and Germany has not done that well. But Estonia has also high internet usage and digital ID cards, so that attitudinal shift is easier.\xe2\x80\x9d \nThe European Commission now plans to break down barriers blocking cross-border investments to make it easier for companies to get the finance they need, regardless of where they  are located.\nChristian Odendahl, chief economist of the Centre for European Reform, said the goal was to diversify the funding for companies, which was  important for the sustainability of their funding base in times of crises.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith access to both capital market and bank funding, firms can adjust funding depending on their needs. The deeper the markets are and the more investors there are to assess the risk, the less costly it will be for borrowers.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\n\nWith access to both capital market and bank funding, firms can adjust funding depending on their needs\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Feature\n\nComment &amp; Analysis\nJernej Omahen\nHead of European financial institutions research, Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\n\nShould Europe\'s bolstered banks look closer to home?\n\r\nThe silver lining of the European financial crisis is that it has led to stronger, better regulated banks, whose capital positions are also much improved. On a broader level, financial stability is now guarded by newly established institutions \xe2\x80\x94 notably, a single bank supervisor (the European Central Bank). Problems remain but they are contained, and relate to a smaller number of banks.\n\r\nCrisis lessons abound. At their centre is the recognition that European banks could often do better with more focused balance sheets and reduced complexity. The new regulatory framework \xe2\x80\x94 which progressively penalises bank size \xe2\x80\x94 underlines this. \n\r\nEuropean banks have taken note, and many of the largest ones have made more effort to reduce their balance sheets. This has three main consequences. \n\r\nFirstly, because Europe\xe2\x80\x99s banks are smaller, with increasingly robust balance sheets, the financial sector as a whole is stronger.\n\r\nSecondly, having smaller banks is likely to result in less freely available bank credit. Currently, this effect is papered over by accommodative monetary policy. But in Europe, where bank financing is essentially the sole funding avenue for most corporates, this is of particular importance. Diversification in financing sources \xe2\x80\x94 away from banks and towards markets \xe2\x80\x94 would therefore benefit Europe\xe2\x80\x99s corporates, and ultimately consumers. \n\r\nThirdly, European banks\xe2\x80\x99 global importance is diminishing. As they retreat, banks struggle to identify long-term strategic alternatives. Indeed, are there any? The eurozone has created a bank union with a single supervisor at its centre. The playing field is levelling out, yet no large bank aims for a pan-eurozone presence. Perhaps, as the bank union matures, the prospect of a European retail and commercial bank at its centre will become a viable, strategic alternative.\nThis content was produced by the Advertising Department of The Times in collaboration with Goldman Sachs.

It was only more recently that it became a serious source of alternative finance for businesses and profit-seeking investors.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOn the financial services side, especially lending, it really started to grow with the crisis of 2008,\xe2\x80\x9d Gajda says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen new interest because of the distress in the banking system and the withdrawal of banks from the SME space.\xe2\x80\x9d Entrepreneurs started turning to platforms such as Crowdcube, FundedByMe and Innovestment to secure funding for their start-up or expansion plans. Some platforms specialise in debt crowdfunding, also known as peer-to-peer lending, where investors expect their money back with interest; others concentrate on equity deals, where investors get shares or a small stake in the business in return for their money; and some do both. Others focus on \xe2\x80\x9creward crowdfunding\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a donation in return for a thank you from a charity, perhaps, or a mention in a new band\xe2\x80\x99s album notes online.\nThe real growth seems to be happening in lending, particularly in the UK. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is because of the regulatory framework,\xe2\x80\x9d Gajda says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Financial Service Authority\xe2\x80\x99s approach is very liberal. Lending platforms are not seen to be doing banking activities, so they do not need a banking licence.\xe2\x80\x9d This is not true in other European nations, such as Germany, where it is a more costly endeavour, making it less attractive to entrepreneurs interested in starting up a financial technology business.\nGovernments that support crowdfunding tend to see it as a way to help the growth of SMEs and, as a result, the economy, says Dr Sovan Mitra, a lecturer in finance at the GCU London business school. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of governments, and people, used to underestimate its importance, but now they see that it could be a key contributor to the economy,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBusinesses can obtain funding without having to go to banks, which might turn them down or impose high costs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe also points out that because crowdfunding platforms are internet-based, they have an affinity for other online businesses and those in the \xe2\x80\x98knowledge economy\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 such as consultancies and so on \xe2\x80\x93 which traditional lenders might not share.\nThat is not to say that traditional financial institutions are ignoring the rise of crowdfunding. An increasing number of institutional investors in Europe are getting involved, in a trend that started in the US, Gajda says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe real growth is coming not from private individuals but from investment funds, high-net-worth individuals, family offices, hedge funds and banks,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are allocating asset tranches to peer-to-peer platforms. This has allowed the industry to issue money into the market at a much greater scale.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMitra agrees: \xe2\x80\x9cSince the crisis, financial institutions are looking at a range of different investments \xe2\x80\x93crowdfunding for instance, but also microfinance \xe2\x80\x93 to get higher returns.\xe2\x80\x9d\nFor institutional investors, crowdfunding offers relatively high returns, but with the risks ameliorated \xe2\x80\x93 just as they are for individuals \xe2\x80\x93 by the platforms spreading their money across a selection of loans rather than allocating it to one or two. It could mean that crowdfunding platforms, or at least some of them, may soon rely much less on the crowd.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe platforms will become less peer-to-peer lenders and more idea generators that offer a portfolio of loans. Or they may become asset-allocation providers,\xe2\x80\x9d Gajda says. Some might choose to focus on risk management by using the data from large numbers of loans plus \xe2\x80\x9csocial forecasting\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a technique that uses social media to determine someone\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile.\nGajda has some advice for potential investors. He says that to minimise risk investors need a diversified portfolio. It is critical you spread your investment across multiple projects \xe2\x80\x93 something that most platforms require, or will even do for you \xe2\x80\x93 if you are looking to lend money through debt crowdfunding, Gajda says. He also advises looking at the platform\xe2\x80\x99s terms and conditions and its track record for selecting borrowers who repay their loans on time. You can expect returns of around 8 per cent, he says.\nIf you are considering equity crowdfunding, you are taking a considerably bigger risk with your money, and you need to be prepared to put a lot more work into managing your investments. The obvious risk is that the company you invest in may go under, but there is also no (official) secondary market for shares allocated this way, so it is usually only possible to recover your initial investment and realise any profits when \xe2\x80\x93 or indeed if \xe2\x80\x93 the business goes public or is sold. On the other hand, if you have the stomach for it and you get a good portfolio with two or three strong companies, Gajda says, \xe2\x80\x9cyou could make a 500 per cent return\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        VIDEO\n                                    \nA dialogue on creating an EU capital markets union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJim Esposito, co-head of the Global Financing Group at Goldman Sachs, discusses the need for deeper and more liquid capital markets in Europe to help support European economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jim Esposito, co-head of the Global Financing Group at Goldman Sachs, discusses the need for deeper and more liquid capital markets in Europe to help support European economic growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent provided by Goldman Sachs.

Banks are shut for two weeks and capital controls enforced while the \xe2\x82\xac10 billion rescue package is negotiated.\nECB President Mario Draghi, pledges to do \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever it takes\xe2\x80\x9d to protect the eurozone from collapse - including fighting unreasonably high government borrowing costs. He later unveils the Outright Monetary Transactions programme, an unlimited but sterilised \xe2\x80\x94 meaning it does not add to the money supply \xe2\x80\x94 bond-buying programme.\n\n\nA new permanent crisis mechanism of around \xe2\x82\xac500bn, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), is inaugurated to build on the EFSF and focuses on prevention and will substantially reduce the probability of a crisis emerging in the future. It replaces the EFSF.\nEU leaders announce that the ECB will be given a supervisory role over the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s 6,000 banks. This will enable the ESM to recapitalise banks directly, rather than lending money to sovereigns to lend on to financial institutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\'13\n\n\n\nThe European Parliament approves the EU bank supervision system, which will bring some 150 of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s largest banks under the European Central Bank\'s direct oversight from September 2014.\n\n\nThe ECB cuts its main refinancing interest rate by 25 basis points to 0.25%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\'14\n\n\n\nGreek unemployment reaches a record high of 28%. Eurozone finance ministers release more than \xe2\x82\xac8 billion of bailout funds to Greece.\n\n\nEurozone ministers approve a two-month extension to Greece\'s bailout, which was set to end 31 December, amid an ongoing dispute over budget provisions between Athens and its EU-IMF creditors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\'15\n\n\n\nIn Greece Syriza wins a snap general election on a mandate of resisting austerity and negotiating debt relief by the EU, IMF and the ECB.\nECB announces a quantitative easing programme under which it will buy \xe2\x82\xac60 billion of sovereign debt every months from this March until the end of September 2016 creating around \xe2\x82\xac1 trillion of new money.\nGreek authorities send a request for a six-month extension to its EU loan programme, but leaders reject the plan. Greece fails to meet the deadline to repay \xe2\x82\xac1.54 billion to the IMF.\n\n\nPrime minister Alexis Tsipras walks out of negotiations with the creditors and calls a referendum among Green voters of whether to accept or reject the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 latest offer that had in any event expired. Greeks vote by 63% to 37% to reject the creditors\xe2\x80\x99 offer.\nTsipras makes a formal bid for new three-year ESM loan that is the centre of a series of weekend meetings in July between the leaders and finance ministers of the eurozone countries. It culminates in the offer of a third \xe2\x82\xac89 billion bailout for Greece in exchange for a tough programme of economic reforms including hikes in VAT, cuts to pension entitlements and privatisation of \xe2\x82\xac50 billion of state-owned assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulation of capital market union was put on back burner\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nEurope has learnt from the financial crisis, says Phil Thornton in the second of a weekly four-part series.\nThe modern European Union may have been forged 65 years ago by the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community, designed to prevent a country mobilising its armed forces without others knowing, but political leaders have always aimed at creating a seamless capital market.\nThe opening declaration of the 1957 Treaty of Rome includes a pledge to abolish all obstacles to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital.\nOne article specifically called on member states to \xe2\x80\x9cprogressively abolish all restrictions on the movement of capital belonging to persons resident in member states and any discrimination based on nationality or on the place where such capital is invested\xe2\x80\x9d.\nBut while the legislation set out the ambition, it took time for policymakers to pass specific laws to make it easier for Europeans to move capital across borders, whether as a bank or as an individual saver or borrower.\nThe creation of the single banking licence in 1989 started the process towards convergence in financial legislation and regulation across member countries, while the launch of the euro in 1999 eliminated currency risk.\nIn the same year, 1999, Brussels launched the Financial Services Action Plan to create a single market for financial services. This culminated in the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) that took effect in November 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 50 years after the Treaty of Rome. It aimed to increase investors\xe2\x80\x99 choice by fostering competition, while at the same time increasing the levels of protection afforded to them.\nYet even by 2004, cross-border deals accounted for only about 20 per cent of the total value of deals within the financial sector \xe2\x80\x94 less than half the average of other sectors where the proportion equalled 45 per cent.\nMore importantly, the system of cross-border regulation failed to keep pace with these dynamic developments. While leaders realised that there would probably have to be some joint regulation, the process remained on the back burner until the global financial crisis struck.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn time-honoured European fashion, the idea was that you would find out over time where you needed the joint regulation and where you could have competing national regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank.\n\xe2\x80\x9cUntil the start of the systemic crisis in 2011 there was not much of a reason to do anything, as things seemed to be working pretty well.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt was only when bond yield spreads soared again after the financial crisis that the question arose: \xe2\x80\x98Is there any pieces of the architecture missing?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\nThere were. The missing elements included the lack of a lender of last resort for a failing bank and a system that resulted in national bank regulators being responsible for supervising large banking groups whose main business was cross-border.\nWhen the crash came, the system was found wanting. The rescue of multinational banks, such as Dexia and Fortis of Belgium, required the governments involved to devise ad hoc burden-sharing agreements after the event.\nAs a major study by leading academics at the Centre for Economic Policy Research concluded in 2011: \xe2\x80\x9cThe national nature of bank rescue operations has meant that there has been a reconsideration of the benefits and costs of cross-border banking.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAn important policy lesson to draw from the crisis is to build a European-level regulatory system that will better support the emergence of a stable European banking system that includes a major role for European-wide major banking groups.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSince the financial crisis struck in 2008, the European Commission has embarked on about 40 new regulations to build what it calls a \xe2\x80\x9csingle rulebook for a single market\xe2\x80\x9d, while MiFID has gone through a comprehensive review. MiFID II should become law on January 3, 2017, although there are rumours it may be delayed by a year.\nSchmieding said that European politicians had not seen these rules as a priority, since Europe had largely been free of financial crises.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn a perfect world they should have done but, having said that, you learn by crisis. Even a perfectly built house can encounter a storm and once in a while the roof may get leaky if the storm is very bad. But the eurozone will be much less at risk of falling prey to a storm than it was before.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nSince the financial crisis struck in 2008, the European Commission has embarked on about  40 new regulations to build what it calls a \xe2\x80\x9csingle rulebook for a single market\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Feature\n\nComment &amp; Analysis\nFrancesco Garzarelli\nCo-head of global macro market research\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\n\nThe European banking and sovereign crisis of 2010-12 exposed the underlying fragilities of the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s financial system. Although we have achieved a degree of stability since then, more work needs to be done before we can reach deep and integrated credit markets across the currency area.\n\r\nWhen significant economic and financial shocks hit home (such as the Great Recession in America and the Greek default), the legal and technical infrastructure of the eurozone proved inadequate to promote an orderly reduction and restructuring of the financial claims agreed during the boom. This led to even more disruption in the credit market, which further worsened the economic downturn. \n\r\nThe European Central Bank (ECB) stepped in as the lender of last resort and offered credit to the banks on very favourable terms. This allowed debtors to reduce their obligations without tipping the economy into depression. The ECB\xe2\x80\x99s support is still in place \xe2\x80\x93 now in the form of quantitative easing \xe2\x80\x93 and expected to continue well into 2017. \n\r\nSome progress has undoubtedly been made since then in addressing some of the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s structural deficiencies. Banks are now better capitalised, and they undergo regular stress-testing to make sure they have an adequate ratio of capital to lending. If there is the risk of a bank collapse in the future, there are clear procedures to manage its orderly resolution without tapping into public finances. At the sovereign level, facilities like the European Stability Mechanism have been developed, allowing states to borrow under joint names and lend to each other on conditional terms. \n\r\nBut more work needs to be done to reduce the segmentation of the credit markets in the euro area. As part of the banking union \xe2\x80\x93 in which responsibility for banking policy was transferred from national governments to the EU \xe2\x80\x93 one of the key features agreed was a common minimum guarantee for bank deposits, but this is still not in place. And there is still a tie between banks and the nation where they are based because last-resort capital injections come from national resources, rather than supranational ones. \n\r\nThere are also many systems that vary across countries \xe2\x80\x93 for example, some financial services are subject to national barriers to entry, and bankruptcy codes and foreclosure procedures still differ across jurisdictions.\n\nThis content was produced by the Advertising Department of The Times in collaboration with Goldman Sachs.

He is the chief financial officer of MyPinPad, a state-of-the-art technology company that specialises in authentication solutions for devices like mobiles and tablets. According to this year\xe2\x80\x99s European Parliament annual report, there are around 22 million SMEs\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n David Muxworthy is adamant that without the EU\xe2\x80\x99s financial assistance, he would have been forced to give up more of the equity in his company to private investors. He is the chief financial officer of MyPinPad, a state-of-the-art technology company that specialises in authentication solutions for devices like mobiles and tablets.\nAccording to this year\xe2\x80\x99s European Parliament annual report, there are around 22 million SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises) like Muxworthy\xe2\x80\x99s operating in the EU, providing two thirds of private sector employment \xe2\x80\x93 around 75 million jobs. The International Monetary Fund describes these sorts of businesses \xe2\x80\x93 agile, innovative, entrepreneurial, job-creating and growing \xe2\x80\x93 as the \xe2\x80\x9cbackbone\xe2\x80\x9d of the European economy. The EU is well aware of SMEs\xe2\x80\x99 importance and has set up a series of financial organisations to help them fulfil their potential. Localisation is a key consideration, and focus is often given to geographical economic \xe2\x80\x9cclusters\xe2\x80\x9d.\nOver the past three years, the MyPinPad team have been grateful beneficiaries of this concentration on localisation, in the form of the UK government\xe2\x80\x99s Smart Specialisation strategy. This integrates investment within a local economy, helping to build more prosperous communities by identifying SMEs that can link together in close proximity.\nMuxworthy says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to be true to our roots and set up an innovative global fintech (financial technology) company in South Wales. There is a huge entrepreneurial spirit in Cardiff and, although the area has traditionally been overlooked for investment, there has been a shift in terms of funding \xe2\x80\x93 EU grants are available through the Welsh Structural Funds programmes and Cardiff city council.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey can be used for training, support, subsidies for premises with high-speed digital facilities, logistical help or funding \xe2\x80\x93 such as the \xc2\xa350,000 we needed \xe2\x80\x93 to get a business off the ground. It\xe2\x80\x99s very lonely and precarious starting your own business, but you get an incredible boost when a government agency or financial goliath shows confidence in you.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThis sort of government support plays a large role in Europe. The business culture is far more risk averse than in America \xe2\x80\x93 where there is a good supply of venture capital, private equity and angel investment \xe2\x80\x93 and mostly relies on bank loans. However, since the financial crisis there has been a reduced credit supply, tighter credit standards and higher bank loan costs. \nIn that environment, the EU\xe2\x80\x99s Investment Plan is another initiative that offers a boon to SMEs. It incorporates a series of measures designed to improve access to finance and markets, as well as boost innovation and competition. \nEuropean Structural and Investment Funds (ESIFs) are the first measure. They involve co-financing projects at the national and regional level in a bid to increase regional competitiveness and wealth creation. The goal is to create hubs of specialist businesses \xe2\x80\x93 such as those focusing on research and innovation or fintech \xe2\x80\x93 by allowing start-ups to apply directly to local authorities. Much of the money for this comes from the European Regional Development Fund, while the European Social Fund finances education and training for entrepreneurs and their employees. British SMEs working on rural or maritime projects can also benefit from two specialist ESIF funds.\nThe second measure is the European Investment Bank (EIB), a non-profit organisation owned by EU member states that borrows money on capital markets to lend on projects (\xc2\xa354 billion in 2014) in areas such as infrastructure and regional development. It has an SME-focused arm, the European Investment Fund. Capital from these sources is processed by local financial institutions which then provide loans to SMEs, often on preferential terms. These are usually financial instruments that complement more traditional grants supplied by banks, such as venture capital funds, private equity and angel investors.\nJonathan Taylor, a vice president at the EIB, says: \xe2\x80\x9cLast year the EIB group provided \xc2\xa315 billion for lending to SMEs, including backing for venture capital, equity, tech transfer, securitisation, lending through high-street banks and microfinance. But we need continued innovation to respond to investment needs. In that vein, we\xe2\x80\x99re preparing to lend \xc2\xa3100 million to UK small businesses through the peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle, and we hope to replicate this model in other countries.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThirdly, there are schemes where businesses apply to specific EU programmes for funding managed by the European Commission. The largest two for SMEs are Horizon 2020 and Cosme (Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises). Horizon 2020 supports projects in innovation, advanced technology and the environment, while Cosme aims to widen SME access to the financial markets by, for instance, providing guarantees or risk capital to equity funds.\nAs well as financial assistance, the EU offers more help in the form of business-support schemes, in areas such as training, IT, cross-border regulations, administration and late payments.\nDespite all of the potential support on offer to SMEs in Europe, there are still problems, says David Muxworthy, mostly due to bureaucracy: \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes time to access the money, there are endless forms to fill in and due diligence can also take ages; sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s six months before you see a penny. It\xe2\x80\x99s complicated, too \xe2\x80\x93 there are so many different avenues and no one\xe2\x80\x99s bringing it all together in a one-stop shop.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe rewards can be great but the system is inefficient \xe2\x80\x93 and if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know where to find the money, many are inclined to give up, or to rely on banks and private equity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        VIDEO\n                                    \nEuropean Crossroads\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAfter discussions with more than 30 leading CEOs in Europe, Richard Tufft, region head of EMEA Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, outlines the challenges facing the region\xe2\x80\x99s economy and shares insights on how Europe can break its cycle of stagnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n After discussions with more than 30 leading CEOs in Europe, Richard Tufft, region head of EMEA Equity Research at Goldman Sachs, outlines the challenges facing the region\xe2\x80\x99s economy and shares insights on how Europe can break its cycle of stagnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent provided by Goldman Sachs.

In July 2012, Cyprus became the fifth eurozone government to request an economic bailout program from the European Commission, European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

For many Europeans, that date is the birthday of the euro.\nYet that event, momentous though it was, was only the final step in an intellectual and political journey that can be traced back to 1970 when then Luxembourg prime minister, Pierre Werner, published a major report on how economic and monetary union (EMU) could be achieved by 1980.\nHowever his report, which proposed fixing national currencies ahead of the possible creation of a single currency, was overshadowed by the collapse of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system and the surge in inflation across Europe.\nIt was not until 1988 that a meeting chaired by the then president of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, defined the objectives of monetary union as not just replacing national currencies with a single unit but also completing the liberalisation of capital movements and full integration of financial markets.\nBut while monetary union went full speed ahead with the establishment of the European Central Bank and the launch of the currency, the creation of a capital markets union \xe2\x80\x94 along with the development of fiscal and political unions \xe2\x80\x94 were left in the slow lane.\nHolger Schmieding, chief economist at the German bank Berenberg and a long standing observer of European integration, said that political leaders had assumed that a single currency would be a stepping stone on the journey to closer union.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThey believed that once you had a single monetary area, capital markets integration would happen on its own,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot much thought was given as to who would be the lender of last resort, or whether diverging national frameworks for capital market regulation would lead to problems in a financial crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat policy of benign neglect suited the creators of the eurozone very well during the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. The eurozone was enjoying stronger growth, more stable housing markets, lower inflation and fewer fiscal problems than the UK.\nEven before the official creation of the single currency there had been substantial capital integration within the eurozone, with large inflows of capital and dramatic convergence of bond yields as investors started to price out different levels of risk between member states.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith rapid integration happening, the idea of needing to think about extra regulations to get more integration did not seem an urgent issue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Schmieding. In a perfect world, he added, the fathers of the European project should have gone further at the time of the Delors report and created a lender of last resort for failing banks.\nAs Jean-Claude Juncker, the current president of the European Commission, said in a major report in June 2014, economic and monetary union was \xe2\x80\x9clike a house that was built over decades but only partially finished\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe Commission itself conceded in September 2015, on the launch of its recent capital markets union initiative, that Europe\xe2\x80\x99s capital markets remain \xe2\x80\x9cfragmented along national lines\xe2\x80\x9d.\nGraham Bishop, a consultant on EU integration, said the idea of creating a capital markets union does go back to the foundations of the EU. \xe2\x80\x9cMore specifically, the 1992 single market programme included all the initial pieces of legislation that are now being modernised and upgraded.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHe added that the original programme was conceived and driven by Lord Cockfield, Margaret Thatcher\xe2\x80\x99s appointee to the European Commission. Therefore it was appropriate that the European commissioner now in charge of overseeing the next stage of the union was Lord Hill, appointed by the current Conservative prime minister David Cameron.\nMr Schmieding said he was encouraged by the fact that policymakers were learning from the crisis. \xe2\x80\x9cAll in all, the proposals go very much in the right direction and basically fix the gaps in the architecture of the eurozone.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\nThe objectives of monetary union are not just replacing national currencies with a single unit but also completing the liberalisation of capital movements and full integration of financial markets\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvertisement Feature\n\nComment &amp; Analysis\nHuw Pill\nChief European Economist, Goldman Sachs\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\n\nThe EU\xe2\x80\x99s financial markets have to work as one if the euro is to flourish. The advent of the single currency promised to be a catalyst for the creation of continent-wide capital markets in Europe, which would, in turn, support economic growth and job creation. But the sustainability of monetary union rested on having an integrated, Europe-wide financial sector that was able to put the single monetary policy into operation throughout the euro area. The first decade of monetary union after 1999 illustrated how well these systems can work together. The absence of currency risks within the euro area created more competitive financial markets and facilitated larger cross-border flows of capital. Credit became more available and borrowing costs fell. As a result, companies were able to invest more than before, enhancing growth prospects. Cross-border capital flows also led to a more deeply integrated financial sector which, in parallel, made it possible for monetary policy to be efficiently passed on to businesses and households, allowing the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain an environment of broadly stable prices and resilient demand. The second decade has proved rather less benign. The global financial crisis disrupted the supply of credit and led to the capital markets once again fragmenting along national lines, interfering with the transmission of monetary policy. Across Europe, macroeconomic stability was put at risk. Moreover, the ECB was unable to provide support to those countries most in need, creating political as well as economic strains that put the future of the euro in question. The threat of a euro break-up exacerbated the fragmentation, creating a vicious downward spiral that had a strong destabilising effect.\r\nEstablishing a true single market for capital entails addressing the institutional shortcomings that underlie the divisions between financial markets. There are efforts at the moment to build a banking union and a capital market union so that the institutions across the EU would operate to common rules, and these are important steps. Without a more integrated and better functioning financial sector, the workability of monetary union will continue to be in question.\nThis content was produced by the Advertising Department of The Times in collaboration with Goldman Sachs.

Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \xe2\x80\x93 firms with fewer than 250 employees and less than 50 million euros in annual turnover \xe2\x80\x93 make up a significant part of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s economy: around 99 per\xe2\x80\xa6\n\n\n\n\n You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a major corporation to make a difference on the European stage, but you may have to fight a little harder to find the funding you need.\nSmall and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) \xe2\x80\x93 firms with fewer than 250 employees and less than 50 million euros in annual turnover \xe2\x80\x93 make up a significant part of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s economy: around 99 per cent of all non-financial companies and two thirds of all jobs.\nLike all businesses, SMEs often rely on injections of capital, to fund new projects or growth. Chris Lowe, a corporate finance specialist at the global accountancy firm EY, says: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s tough out there for SMEs because they are very entrepreneurially driven and that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make the best kind of prospect for banks, which want a swift return on their investments.\xe2\x80\x9d To add to the challenge for SMEs seeking funding, the structure of the EU means that they face very different financing options in each country.\nVarious types of funding are used in different nations as each has its own financing costs, interest rates and credit conditions, as well as distinct monetary policies and tax frameworks, with those in southern Europe often offering the most challenging conditions for SMEs. At the same time, there is less supervision and regulation in newer EU states, which can make investment there less attractive for equity crowdfunding.\nOf the SME financing in the EU, it is generally accepted that about 80% comes from banks and 20 per cent from equity. This is a very different environment from the US, where there is a different attitude to risk \xe2\x80\x93 in 2014, for example, \xc2\xa320 billion was raised through venture capital there, compared with \xc2\xa33.5 billion in the EU.\nThe EU figure masks variation across regions. Rick Watson, the head of capital markets at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe \xe2\x80\x93 which recently released a special report on SME funding issues across the EU \xe2\x80\x93 says: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the financial crisis hit, funding opportunities changed between countries. For instance, SMEs in southern Europe, where perhaps the recession lasted longer because of economic sluggishness, found it particularly tough to raise capital.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOnce bank after bank has said no, an SME might just stop trying, as it cannot access a developed capital network like the one in the US \xe2\x80\x93 where governments, universities, banks and individual investors work together. That fragmentation is a piece of the puzzle that EU authorities need to solve.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlthough loans are still very important in most countries, many other models of financing are now available \xe2\x80\x93 such as private equity, venture capital, business angels and crowdfunding \xe2\x80\x93 but uptake of these and other innovative approaches varies.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe UK has led the way in more adventurous forms of SME capital investment,\xe2\x80\x9d Watson says, \xe2\x80\x9csuch as peer-to-peer, venture capital and crowdfunding. Other countries, such as those in Scandinavia, and especially Sweden, saw that becoming a \xe2\x80\x98specialist\xe2\x80\x99 in a certain type of tech SME, would lead to greater chances of outside investment. And in Germany, the solution has been collaborative, with the funding community working together impressively to create greater access to capital.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWestern Europe is far more open to the use of so-called non-banks, including loan funds, crowdfunding platforms, leasing companies, insurers, invoice finance providers, community finance organisations and large corporates. This is in part because of stronger internal economies but also because SMEs represent a less risky investment, as they can often show a good track record. This open-mindedness has led to individual states specialising in certain types of financing \xe2\x80\x93 Luxembourg and Ireland, for instance, lead the way in investment funds, and the UK is ahead of the game with private equity.\nHowever, differences in lending rates can mean SMEs in some nations can\xe2\x80\x99t afford some of the newer loan systems. For instance, a typical crowdfunding lending rate in the UK is about 4 per cent \xe2\x80\x93 in Spain it can be three times that.\nThe use of listed shares is common in western Europe whereas debt securities are generally unavailable to firms in the least developed EU countries. In addition, businesses in southern Europe (especially those owned and run by families) are hugely reluctant to cede control to capital markets rather than banks. In 2013, for instance, Italian SMEs received \xc2\xa3163 billion in bank loans compared to just \xc2\xa3700 million in private equity.\nMeanwhile, SMEs in some countries (France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the UK) have benefited from funding and advice issued by public investment banks owned by the state, a facility not shared in other European states.\nEquity finance is more limited too \xe2\x80\x93 the EU\xe2\x80\x99s stockmarkets were worth 64.5 per cent of GDP in 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 half of America\xe2\x80\x99s 138 per cent. And market capitalisations vary across the EU: in the same period Britain\xe2\x80\x99s was more than 120 per cent of GDP compared with just 35 per cent for Italy \xe2\x80\x93 another reason for the country\xe2\x80\x99s over-reliance on banks.\nAll of this diversity creates challenges for those trying to simplify life for SMEs. The European Commission\xe2\x80\x99s new \xc2\xa3221 billion European Fund for Strategic Investments, which aims to plug the gap in funding for SMEs, will go some way to sparking their growth, but some commentators identify equity finance as the missing factor.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a message that SMEs want to hear \xe2\x80\x93 especially on the continent \xe2\x80\x93 but ultimately it\xe2\x80\x99s equity finance that\xe2\x80\x99s going to help a business,\xe2\x80\x9d Lowe says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a terrible muddle out there at the moment and pan-European authorities need to co-ordinate their investment strategies much better and encourage more equity financing \xe2\x80\x93 that way there will be a better path to stability for SMEs.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        MORE FROM THE TIMES\n                                    \nHow business schools are helping to shape Europe\xe2\x80\x99s financial future\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s MBA and finance graduates are tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s investment bankers \xe2\x80\x93 and, quite possibly, the industry\xe2\x80\x99s policymakers and regulators.

You have to know what investment banks are doing in markets, but on the other hand business schools also provide views and guidelines that, in a sense, try to imagine the future. And in many cases those views become models.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBusiness schools are focusing their attention on the efficiency of capital markets and the benefits to be gained from market integration and banking union across Europe, says Mayer. \xe2\x80\x9cA second element is the role of banking and the funding of investment in Europe, particularly the financing of small and medium sized businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d Regulation and its effects on European financial markets is a third critical strand, while the role of governance and ownership in equity markets is the final part of the foundation.\nAs a result Mayer expects to see increasing pressure for Europe to take a strong stance on capital market integration and banking union. \xe2\x80\x9cFinancial markets in Europe will be expected to play a more effective role in terms of financing capital investment. There is concern that investment in Europe has been held back because of a failure of banking systems in particular, but also capital markets more generally, to provide the depth of funding that is needed and is observed in, for example, the US.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTheo Vermaelen, a professor of finance at Insead, in Fontainebleau, is less sure about the impact that he and his academic peers will have on the markets\xe2\x80\x99 futures. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all like to think that we have a huge impact as professors, but it is probably limited,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cEducation can make a difference but it is a long process. The people we teach are young and not very powerful. We have to hope that what we teach them, they remember for 20 years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nOne area where he has seen academic influence at work is in relation to the US markets. Most high-profile academics at European schools have studied and undertaken significant research in the US and are likely to be more familiar with US markets than the full spread of European market, says Vermaelen. Another factor is that it is easier to study US market data, as it is more complete and accessible; US-focused research also makes it easier for professors to get papers published in prestigious American journals.\nAs a result, market innovations from the States end up on European business school curriculums, he says; this may go on to shape the tools and techniques used here. For example, he teaches students about share buybacks \xe2\x80\x93 popular in the US in the wake of the financial crisis \xe2\x80\x93 although some students question why they are learning about an area that has not caught on here. \xe2\x80\x9cI say, \xe2\x80\x98It is your role to be business leaders of the future, to make sure that these things get implemented\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vermaelen. \xe2\x80\x9cI predict that what happens in America will come to Europe, with some delay.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBusiness schools\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with capital markets reflects the cyclical nature of financial markets themselves, says Caselli. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years ago professors aimed to create theories and models to make new tools to run businesses, such as derivatives. Now theories and models are designed to support regulators. In ten or twenty years that will change\xe2\x80\xa6 it is the story of financial markets since the beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMayer adds: \xe2\x80\x9cIn response to the financial crisis there has been more emphasis on macro issues, on the protection of the financial system as a whole. That is something I believe will accelerate over the next few years. There will be attempts to provide better coordination across different regulatory bodies across European capital markets.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe student\xe2\x80\x99s view: I need to understand it all\nAlexander Reneby, 28, thinks that the future of European capital markets will be shaped by graduates with a strong grasp of both the quantitative and business aspects of the markets. He chose his course \xe2\x80\x93 a masters in finance taught at Lund University, in Sweden, and Emlyon, in Lyon \xe2\x80\x93 because it offered both elements. \xe2\x80\x9cThe financial crisis showed that there were a lot of people in sales selling things that they did not fully understand, and mathematicians building models that they did not know what they were for,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that created a lot of problems. People have to have a solid foundation of knowledge in both parts even if they then specialise. I think that students have a responsibility to look for business schools that teach both theory and practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                        VIDEO\n                                    \nEncouraging Growth: The Role of the European Banking Union\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nJernej Omahen, head of the European Financial Institutions Group in Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, discusses how the European banking union aims to reduce financial risk and encourage economic growth across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Jernej Omahen, head of the European Financial Institutions Group in Global Investment Research at Goldman Sachs, discusses how the European banking union aims to reduce financial risk and encourage economic growth across Europe.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContent provided by Goldman Sachs.
