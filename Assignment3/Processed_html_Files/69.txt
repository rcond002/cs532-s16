The 36-year-old, who came up in Compton, has managed to stand the test of time and remain a consistent, accomplished artist.\nGetting his start in the early 2000s under Dr. Dre\xe2\x80\x99s Aftermath imprint, the Game was later placed on 50 Cent\xe2\x80\x99s G-Unit Records via Dre and Jimmy Iovine. With East Coast hip-hop dominating radio at the time, the Game was able to bring back West Coast rap to the forefront with his critically-acclaimed album, The Documentary. Backed by the smash hits, \xe2\x80\x9cHow We Do\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHate It or Love It,\xe2\x80\x9d the album received two Grammy nominations and debuted at the number one spot on the Billboard 200, selling over five million copies worldwide.\nAlthough, the success of Game\xe2\x80\x99s debut album spoke volumes, internally, the relationship between 50 Cent and the Game became tainted after they were involved in a few public disputes. This eventually led Game to sign under Universal Music Group\xe2\x80\x99s Interscope-Geffen-A&amp;M division, helping him terminate his contractual obligations with G-Unit in the summer of 2006.\nProving that he was still able to make good music on his own with no major co-signs, Game has gone on to release six noteworthy LPs, a slew of mixtapes and some EPs. The rhymer has even transitioned his success in music over to the big screen, appearing in Waist Deep and Street Kings, to name a few. His appeal has even reached video gamers with his voice used as a role on Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and Def Jam: Icon.\nXXL looks back at the Game\xe2\x80\x99s successful career thus far and highlights the better tracks in his catalog. Here are 20 Best the Game Songs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Get Far\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Kanye West  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nFor Game\xe2\x80\x99s third single off his Doctor\xe2\x80\x99s Advocate album, the Compton MC released the Kanye West-produced-and-featured-track, \xe2\x80\x9cWouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Get Far.\xe2\x80\x9d The single, released in 2007, featured both rappers name-dropping the baddest chicks in the game at the time as they exchanged bars about the scandalous things video vixens do behind closed doors to get ahead in the industry. The controversial song peaked at No. 64 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cHate It or Love It\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring 50 Cent  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nOne of the classics that spawned from Game\xe2\x80\x99s debut album was the 50 Cent-assisted \xe2\x80\x9cHate It or Love It.\xe2\x80\x9d Produced by Cool &amp; Dre with additional production from Dr. Dre and B.G. Knocc Out, the song peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was a commercial success worldwide. Receiving two Grammy nods for the song at the 2006 Grammy Awards, Game lost, but earned the respect of his rap peers for the concept of the track.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOld English\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nAnother highlight from the Game\xe2\x80\x99s sophomore album was the deep cut titled \xe2\x80\x9cOld English.\xe2\x80\x9d Focusing on his struggles and upbringing in Compton, Game paints a picture of his cruel reality as he drops laid-back flows over the funky and mellow sounds provided by Hi-Tek. The standout track is still considered as one of the best and heartfelt records the 36-year-old has made in his extensive career.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cJesus Piece\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Kanye West &amp; Common \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nServing as the title track for Game\xe2\x80\x99s fifth studio album, \xe2\x80\x9cJesus Piece\xe2\x80\x9d finds him teaming up once again with Kanye West along with the addition of Chicago MC Common.

Comparing their relationship to Bonnie and Clyde, the Los Angeles rapper wines and dines his lady on the track while Nate Dogg provides the catchy, gangsta hook.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cLike Father, Like Son\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Busta Rhymes  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nAnother standout track off Game\xe2\x80\x99s critically-acclaimed debut album is the Busta Rhymes-assisted \xe2\x80\x9cLike Father, Like Son.\xe2\x80\x9d Dedicated to The Game\xe2\x80\x99s first born child, Jaycon Taylor recalls the moments in which his wife was about to give birth and how he hopes to give his first born, Harlem Caron Taylor, a better life than the ganngsta reality he was exposed to as a young child in the city of Compton.

The song also features a hook done by Shorty of Da Lench Mob.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPut You On the Game\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Timbaland \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nIn the midst of Game\xe2\x80\x99s beef with G-Unit, \xe2\x80\x9cPut You On the Game\xe2\x80\x9d was released as the fifth and final single off his critically-acclaimed debut LP, The Documentary. The song, produced by Timbaland and co-produced by Danja, featured The Game name-dropping several artists and classic albums in the hip-hop genre. With several remixes made, the record received more international love than in the U.S.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWestside Story\xe2\x80\x9d \n  The Game featuring 50 Cent  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nReleased as the debut single off Game\xe2\x80\x99s first LP, The Documentary, this track became the first time mainstream raps fans saw the Los Angeles rapper team up with his now foe, 50 Cent. With the song debuting at No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100, this record introduced rap fans to the Dr. Dre protege.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the King\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nOff his Purp &amp; Patron mixtape, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the King\xe2\x80\x9d became the first song leaked from the effort. Becoming the standout track of the project, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m the King\xe2\x80\x9d served as a warm up for Game\xe2\x80\x99s The R.E.D. Album. While the track may not be one of Game\xe2\x80\x99s most lyrical songs, it helped showcase to fans that he was still able to make hits with minimal effort.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c100\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Drake  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nReleased as the first single off Game\xe2\x80\x99s sixth studio album, \xe2\x80\x9c100\xe2\x80\x9d features Drake exchanging bars about loyalty and truth with the West Coast rhymer over production from Johnny Juliano and Cardo. With the Toronto native providing the perfect hook, Game keeps it \xe2\x80\x9c100\xe2\x80\x9d throughout the soulful backdrop. The song helped Game peak hit the Billboard Hot 100 once again and receive international love in Germany, Canada and the U.K.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe City\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Kendrick Lamar  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nProduced by Cool &amp; Dre, \xe2\x80\x9cThe City\xe2\x80\x9d became one of the standout tracks off Game\xe2\x80\x99s fourth studio album, The R.E.D. Album. Released in 2011, the song features Game pairing up with Kendrick Lamar, who provided the hard-hitting chorus over the production of the Florida natives. With stellar verses from both MCs, the song ranks among the best tracks from Game.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cMartians vs. Goblins\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Tyler, The Creator  \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nThe Game and Tyler, the Creator teamed up in 2011 for the record, \xe2\x80\x9cMartians vs. Goblins,\xe2\x80\x9d off the Compton rapper\xe2\x80\x99s The R.E.D. Album. The song, which peaked at No. 100 on the Billboard Hot 100, features references to Rihanna, Lil B and more. The bizarre lyrics and collaboration was a plus for both artists\xe2\x80\x99 fans, helping to increase their network of supporters.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy You Hate the Game\xe2\x80\x9d \n The Game featuring Nas &amp; Marsha Ambrosius \n\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\nOver production from Just Blaze, Game tapped Nas and Marsha Ambrosia in 2006 for the track \xe2\x80\x9cWhy You Hate the Game.\xe2\x80\x9c With the Compton rapper shinning bright alongside the New York vet, Game does a great job of staying in pocket with the soulful Just Blaze production. Ambrosia handles the chorus duties on the track while Game opens up to his critics and haters.\n\n \xc2\xa0 \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nSee 40 Hip-Hop Albums Turning 20 in 2016\n\n\twindow.TSM = window.TSM || {};\n\twindow.TSM.photogalleryConfigs = window.TSM.photogalleryConfigs || [];\n\tvar photogalleryConfig = {\n\t\tgalleryUrl:\'/api/json/galleries/545899?filterexclusions&galleryindex=0\'\n\t\t,galleryId:\'tsm-photogallery-812-545899-0\'\n\t\t,showThumbs:0\n\t\t,colorscheme:\'dark\'\n\t\t\n\t\t,dozIndexTweak:1\n\t\t,refreshRate:1\n\t\t,enableFullscreen:1\n\t\t,expandOnLoadHash:0\n\t\t,portraitMode:0\n\t\t,initImage:\'http://www.xxlmag.com/files/2016/01/Fugees-Ghostface-2Pac.jpg\'\n\t};\n\twindow.TSM.photogalleryConfigs.push( photogalleryConfig );\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage  of \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\nSubscribe to XXL on \n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under: The Game | The List Category: News \n\n\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\n\nREDDIT\n\n\n\nMore\n\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\n\nPrint this page\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tfunction TSMTrackGPlus(data){\n\t\t\t\tvar gaPrimaryAccount = \'\';\n\t\t\t\tif(typeof window.TSM !== undefined) {\n\t\t\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tgaPrimaryAccount = window.TSM.ga.accounts[0];\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\tcatch(err){\n\t\t\t\t\t\tthrow \'primary google analytics account not found\';\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\tif(data.state=="on"){\n\t\t\t\t\tif( _gaq !== undefined && gaPrimaryAccount !== \'\'){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_gaq.push(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[ \'_setAccount\', gaPrimaryAccount ],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'_trackEvent\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'social\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'Gplus\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata.href\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}else if(data.state=="off"){\n\t\t\t\t\tif( _gaq !== undefined && gaPrimaryAccount !== \'\'){\n\t\t\t\t\t\t_gaq.push(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[ \'_setAccount\', gaPrimaryAccount ],\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'_trackEvent\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'social\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\'Gminus\',\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdata.href\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t]\n\t\t\t\t\t\t);\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t(function() {\n\t\t\t\tif(!document.getElementById(\'google-plus-loaded\')){\n\t\t\t\t\tvar po = document.createElement(\'script\');
