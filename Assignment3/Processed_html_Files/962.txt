While evenings are still slightly chilly, sunny days bring a feeling of early summer and tourists can be seen sunbathing quite frequently throughout the season. While the ocean is still too cool for a swim, the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s pools are often occupied during the brighter hours of the day. Temperatures reach 18 degrees Celsius.

Yes Malta may be fairly small, but it\xe2\x80\x99s got everything a traveller could dream of! From history to architecture, traditions to nightlife\xe2\x80\xa6.and the list goes on! Malta has even made it onto Buzzfeed as the most underrated country in the Mediterranean\xe2\x80\xa6 need we say more?!\r   The Malta Direct Team didn\xe2\x80\x99t want you to underestimate Malta either, so we have written down 10 amazing facts about Malta that you probably didn\xe2\x80\x99t know before! \r 1) Malta is an archipelago  So we have already mentioned that Malta is one of the smallest countries in the world, but did you know that it is comprised of seven tiny islets? Malta and Gozo are the two largest islands which are inhabited, while Comino is only inhabited during the summer months when the luxury vacation resort is open. The remaining four on the other hand are totally uninhabited. \r 2) Malta has been sweet since the ancient times  Since long time ago, the Maltese Islands were famous in the ancient world, for the special blended and spicy honey made by the Maltese honey bees and in fact the Greeks named the island as \'Melite\' with the Romans renaming it to \'Melita\', which translates into \xe2\x80\x9cthe island of honey\xe2\x80\x9d. Apart from the unique spicy taste, Maltese honey has been found to be useful for its healing properties especially in the case of colds and cough. \r 3) Malta\xe2\x80\x99s national dog will surprise you  The Pharaoh Hound is a breed of dog and the national hound of the Mediterranean nation of Malta. Its native name is Kelb tal-Fenek in Maltese, which means "Rabbit dog". The dog is traditionally used for hunting rabbit in the Maltese Islands. \r 4) The Maltese love to celebrate  Did you know Malta puts on a staggering 75 villages feasts to honour local patron saints between June and September? The festa (feast) in Maltese, is a fabulous event with fireworks, bands and a religious procession. If you\xe2\x80\x99re there during those times, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a visit!\r 5) Malta is super old (and there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence!)  Malta is one of the most isolated spots on the Mediterranean (just have a look at the map!), but there\xe2\x80\x99s evidence to suggest that civilisations have been living in Malta since the early Neolithic period of 5000 B, that\xe2\x80\x99s more than 7,400 years ago! The proof that this country is ancient comes in the form of the Megalithic temples, which are the oldest free-standing stone structures in the world and are UNESCO World Heritage Site listed.\r 6) Malta has seen a miracle!  The dome of the Mosta Dome, which is the third largest in Europe, famously survived a fallen bomb during WWII.\r 7) Malta\xe2\x80\x99s fairly new to independence  Malta has only been an independent country for the last 51 years, as it was colonised for 150 years by the British. It gained stated independency in 1964, became a republic in 1974 and in 2004 became part of the European Union. While no longer tied to the UK officially, the Maltese still drive on the left side of the road like the British and have even left the traces of the British culture, such as the red phone boxes. \r 8) Malta\xe2\x80\x99s made it to Hollywood, multiple times!  Malta is the country where movies and series are made, and is a personal favourite destination for Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie with the filming of \xe2\x80\x9cBy the Sea\xe2\x80\x9d most recently. Due to its unspoilt nature, beautiful coastline and ancient surroundings, it\xe2\x80\x99s no question about why Hollywood loves Malta! A few famous productions that have taken place there over the years have been \xe2\x80\x9cPoppeye\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cTroy\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cGladiator\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cGame of Thrones\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cWorld War Z\xe2\x80\x9d,\xe2\x80\xa6. And the list goes one!\r 9) Malta will spoil you for choice!  Did you know there are approximately 365 churches in Malta? That\xe2\x80\x99s one for every day of the year! With Malta\xe2\x80\x99s history, culture and traditions, there\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise to this fabulous fact! \r 10)\tMalta has marked it\xe2\x80\x99s firsts in Europe  Did you know that Valletta was the first ever planned city in Europe? The city was sketched out in 1565 during the Order of St. John of Jerusalem by Grand Master La Valette. He planned the city as a refuge to care for injured soldiers and pilgrims during the Crusades in the 16th century. Valletta was completed in just 15 years, and is known today as one of the quickest scaled cities of the world. The Grand Master Valette didn\xe2\x80\x99t live to see its completion, however the new city was named in honour of him. \nView full article \n\n\r\n\tvar description = $(\'desc_2937\').innerHTML;\r\n\tif (description.length > 100){\r\n\t\t$(\'desc_2937\').innerHTML = description.substr(0, 100) + "...";\r\n\t}\r\n\n\nSave up to 18% with our fantastic 4 star offer!\nMalta Direct are pleased to share with you this great offer at the popular four star Seashells Resort at Suncrest, you can stay for 3 nights bed and breakfast from just \xc2\xa3185 per person, that\xe2\x80\x99s a saving of up to 18%  What\xe2\x80\x99s included: Return flights\rReturn transfers\r3 Nights in an Economy Room\rBreakfast\r24 hour overseas representation\r Additional costs and extras Checked in baggage is available from \xc2\xa334 per bag per person\rUpgrade to half board available from \xc2\xa310 per night\rUpgrade to all inclusive available from \xc2\xa315 per night\rRoom upgrade available from \xc2\xa33.50 per night\rLonger durations are available\r Available 3 Nights in June \rfrom \xc2\xa3185 per person \r 5 Nights in June \rfrom \xc2\xa3259 per person \r 7 Nights in June \rfrom \xc2\xa3309 per person \r 7 Nights in July or August \rfrom \xc2\xa3419 per person\r 7 Nights in September \rfrom \xc2\xa3379 per person\rCall our friendly reservations team to book now on 0808 102 2208   About the hotel Ideally situated on the Qawra seafront, the Seashells Resort at Suncrest enjoys beautiful views across the bay of Qawra.

Indeed the craft of pyrotechnics in Malta goes back to the time of the Order of the Knights of St John, and they must have been inspired by cannon shots and musket fire. Fireworks developed into a craft when the Maltese started to celebrate the events connected to their British rulers in the 19th and 20th centuries. The Maltese islands are renowned for the love of fireworks, which form a core part of most celebrations or events organised. This year\xe2\x80\x99s Malta International Fireworks Festival event will prove to be an added reason to visit some of Malta\xe2\x80\x99s most scenic and historic spots during April and May. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t make it in April or May, no need to worry, if you fly to Malta any time between June and mid-September you will be surprised to find that firework displays will be taking place practically every weekend!\r Malta\'s International Fireworks Festivalflash 16cameramake NIKON CORPORATIONheight 3264lat: 35.962864long: 14.358594camerasoftware Adobe Photoshop Lighoriginaldate 4/26/2012 1:18:36 AMwidth 4928cameramodel NIKON D7000flash 16cameramake NIKON CORPORATIONheight 3264lat: 35.933644long: 14.343811camerasoftware Adobe Photoshop Lighoriginaldate 4/29/2013 3:43:31 AMwidth 2162cameramodel NIKON D7000flash 16cameramake NIKON CORPORATIONheight 2513lat: 35.838950long: 14.545833camerasoftware Adobe Photoshop Lighoriginaldate 4/27/2013 3:11:09 AMwidth 3793cameramodel NIKON D7000  Have a look at last year\xe2\x80\x99s event on video below!
