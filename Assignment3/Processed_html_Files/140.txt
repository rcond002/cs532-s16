For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "The New York Times" include NYTimes.com and The New York Times newspaper.\nThe New York Times Replica Edition, maintained by NewspaperDirect, is governed by its own Privacy Policy.\nThe New York Times advertising portal, for advertisers of The Times, also maintains a separate Privacy Policy.\nThe NYT Services may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites.\nThis Privacy Policy covers:\n\nWhat information do we gather about you?\nWhat do we do with the information we collect about you?\nWith whom do we share the information that we gather?\nWhat is our email policy?\nHow do I change or update my personal information?\nHow do I opt-out from receiving emails?\nIs my information protected?\nCompliance With Legal Process\nChildren\'s Guidelines\nYour California Privacy Rights\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\n\n\n TRUSTe: The New York Times has received TRUSTe\'s Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal.\nIf you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact TRUSTe at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request.\n\n\n\nThe TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through the NYTimes.com website. The TRUSTe program does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this site.\n\nWHAT INFORMATION DO WE GATHER ABOUT YOU?\nThe information gathered when you interact with the NYT Services falls into two categories: 1) Personal information, which includes personal information you supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for one of our sites, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) Non-personal information collected through technology, which includes tracking information collected by us as well as third parties.\nPersonal Information That You Give Us Or Ask a Third Party to Share with Us\nRegistration Information\nRegistration for the NYT Services may require that you supply certain personal information, including a unique email address and demographic information (ZIP code, age, sex, household income, job industry and job title) to register.\nYou may register or enhance your profile by linking your Facebook or Google accounts on NYTimes.com. By doing this, you are asking them to send us certain information from those social media accounts, and you are authorizing us to collect, store, and use what they send us in accordance with this Privacy Policy. You can unlink your social media accounts or control what they share from their privacy controls.\nSocial media registration features may collect your IP address, the page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our web site.\nYou can disassociate your NYTimes.com registration from third-party accounts any time. For more detail, please see our Social Media FAQ.\nBilling and Credit Card Information\nTo enable payment and donations via the NYT Services, we collect and store name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information and other billing information. This information will only be shared with third parties who help to complete the purchase transaction. Examples of this include fulfilling orders and processing credit card payments.\nUser Generated Content and Public Activities (Including Comments, Reader Reviews and TimesPeople)\nWe offer you opportunities to engage in public activities on NYTimes.com and other NYT Services. "Public activities" are any actions you take on NYTimes.com that are designed to be visible to other users, including comments, recommendations, reader reviews, ratings or any other items that you submit. Any information you disclose in your public activities, along with your screen name or ID, or any image or photo, becomes public and may be used by The New York Times for online and offline promotional or commercial uses in any and all media. If you choose to engage in public activities, you should be aware that any personal information you submit can be read, collected and used by other users of these areas. We are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in the course of your public activities and we have no responsibility to publish, take down, remove or edit any of your public activities or submissions. For more information, see the Comments FAQ and read the Forums, Discussions and User Generated Content section of the Terms of Service.\nPublic activities may be included in our RSS feeds, APIs and other distribution formats. As a result, your public activities may appear on other websites, blogs, or feeds. Keep in mind that we are not responsible for any personal information you choose to make public via your public activities, and you agree that such sharing will be deemed to have been done by you, not The New York Times. Please see our Comments FAQ for additional information.\nWhen you share or recommend links to content on a third-party platform (such as Facebook, Google+ and Twitter), that action and any information you share will be covered by their privacy policy.\nContests, Sweepstakes and Special Offers\nThe New York Times collects personal information from you when you participate in sweepstakes, contests or special offers. If this information is also being collected by a third party other than The New York Times, we will notify you at the same time. If you do not want any personal information shared, you should not participate in the sweepstakes, contest or special offer.\nReader Surveys, Reader Panels and Market Research\nThe New York Times may collect personal information from you in connection with voluntary surveys conducted via the NYT Services. Data may be collected through the NYT Services, on the phone or through the mail. The information you provide may be shared, but only in the aggregate, with advertisers and partners unless we notify you otherwise at the time of collection.\nMembers of our Reader Panels agree to participate in surveys, polls or discussions about their readership of The New York Times, their household/personal characteristics and their purchase behavior. Our panels are currently administered by Vision Critical and Beta Research.\nConferences and Live Events\nWe often receive information about attendees to our live events from sign-in and registration lists. We may share this information with event or promotion\xc2\xa0sponsors, in which case we will notify you when we collect the information.\nNon-Personal Information Collected Using Technology\nInformation Collected by Us Using Technology\nWe use various Internet technologies to manage the NYT Services and track use of the Services.

We do this to improve services we offer you, including customized Recommendations, advertising and currency display, to improve marketing, and to track access and use of the NYT Services across the devices that you use to access the NYT Services.\nFor more information on the Recommendations feature, please read the Recommendations FAQ.\nWe have hired third parties to provide us information, reports and analysis about the usage, browsing patterns of our users. They may independently record the type of device and operating system you are using, general location information, as well as events that occur within our apps, such as how often you use our apps.\nLocation Information. Some of our mobile applications can deliver content based on your current location if you choose to enable that feature of the app. If you enable the location-based feature, your current location will be stored locally on your device, which will then be used by the app. If you elect to have a location-based search saved to your history, we will store that information on our servers. If you do not enable the location-based service, or if an app does not have that feature, the app will not transmit to us, and we will not collect or store, location information.\nThe ads in our apps are not targeted to you based on your current GPS location, but they may be targeted to you based on your ZIP code or device\'s IP address.\nThird Parties\nSome of the services and advertisements included in the NYT Services, including on NYTimes.com and within our mobile apps, are delivered or served by third-party companies, which may collect information about your use of the NYT Services.\nThese companies may place or recognize cookies, Web beacons or other technology to track certain non-personal information about our website users. For example, in the course of serving certain advertisements, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser in order to collect certain information about your use of the NYT Services. For another example, an advertiser or ad server may also be able to collect your device\xe2\x80\x99s unique identifier in the course of serving an ad. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests.\nWe do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties\' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.\nPlease click here to see a list of third parties that may be using cookies to serve advertising on our websites or in our apps.
