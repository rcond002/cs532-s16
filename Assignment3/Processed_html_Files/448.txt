Trinidad beat Guatemala 2-1 last week.\n\nGET STATS AND LINEUPS FROM THE MATCH\n\nHead coach Jurgen Klinsmann made a handful of changes from Friday\xe2\x80\x99s win over St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, most notably handing veteran goalkeeper Tim Howard just his second start since he returned from his self-imposed hiatus following\xc2\xa0his heroics against Belgium in the 2014 World Cup.\xc2\xa0\nKeeping the flat 4-4-2 formation from Friday, Klinsmann also slid LA Galaxy forward Gyasi Zardes from the right wing up top alongside Jozy Altidore, moving Bobby Wood to the bench and DeAndre Yedlin from right back to the wing and Michael Orozco off the bench to right\xc2\xa0back.\nThe US backline was\xc2\xa0tested right away when, 20 seconds in, Kenwyne Jones broke free on the right wing for an open cross to the Chicago Fire midfielder\xc2\xa0Joevin Jones at the top of the box. Jones sent his right-footed blast well high, however.\nThe Soca Warriors had another golden opportunity in the 13th minute when Kenwyne Jones took a long ball at the edge of the area, fended off Orozco, spun and fired just high.\nThe USMNT began to pick up steam on the 20-minute mark, when both Fabian Johnson and Altidore fired off shots.\xc2\xa0\n\nGet more USMNT news and notes from MLSsoccer.com\n\nThe Americans rocked onto the front foot in the second half, nearly finding the opener in the 47th minute when Altidore sent a perfect cross across the box to Zardes, who rose up for a booming header that clanged off the bar.\nThe US found woodwork again in the 78th minute\xc2\xa0when Jermaine Jones took a go from nearly 40 yards out, a right-footed shot that beat goalkeeper Jan Michael-Williams but grazed off the top of the bar.\xc2\xa0\nIn the end, even with the offensive\xc2\xa0substitutions\xc2\xa0of Portland Timbers attacker Darlington Nagbe -- making\xc2\xa0his second USMNT appearance in his first camp --\xc2\xa0and Wood, the Yanks were unable to pierce the Soca Warriors&amp;apos; defense.\xc2\xa0\nThe USMNT will complete the first round of Group 2 matches when they face Guatemala twice in a home and away during the March 2016 FIFA window.\xc2\xa0\nConnection Lost.
