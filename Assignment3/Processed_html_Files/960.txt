Its seven-story-high log lobby is unique in American architecture. Created with gnarled logs and rough-sawn wood from the Northern Pacific Railroad, it has a sense of place as identifiable as the park itself. But that\'s not the only thing special about this 100+-year-old hotel. It is also steps from the world-famous Old Faithful Geyser, where you can count on the clockwork timing of its plume of steam that soars skyward every hour. When you are not outside marveling at this natural wonder, you can enjoy the Inn\'s immense lobby and huge stone fireplace, comfortable rooms and a great restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Night 4\r\n                                :\r\n                                Lake Yellowstone Hotel\r\n                                - \r\n                                    Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally built in 1891, the stately Lake Yellowstone Hotel is the oldest historic hotel in remote Yellowstone National Park. The hotel, which is situated on the shores of lovely Lake Yellowstone, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its graceful, refined ambiance recalls the 1920s. The views from the hotel dining room out over the lake are magnificent, as are the vistas from the tranquil Sunroom.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Night 5\r\n                                :\r\n                                Holiday Inn\xc2\xae Cody at Buffalo Bill Village\r\n                                - \r\n                                    Cody, Wyoming\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that more than 93% of all American travelers have stayed in a Holiday Inn? That\'s because they know they can find friendly services, comfortable accommodations, and welcome amenities at this well-known hotel chain. The Holiday Inn\xc2\xae Cody at Buffalo Bill Village is no exception. It\xe2\x80\x99s just blocks away from the Buffalo Bill Historical Center and close to the Cody Nite Rodeo and Dan Miller\xe2\x80\x99s Music Revue, offering you one of the best locations in this historic "Old West" town. There\xe2\x80\x99s an outdoor swimming pool and a small fitness facility when you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to wind down after a busy day and an on-site laundromat available to guests. The Bottoms Up Lounge is a great place to relax after a busy day.\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Night 6\r\n                                :\r\n                                The Ranch at Ucross\r\n                                - \r\n                                    Ucross, Wyoming\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo trip to the great American West would be complete without a visit to a real dude ranch. Days start with a cowboy breakfast spread, and end with a dinner buffet that has everything from grilled trout to Wyoming beef and tender chicken \xe2\x80\x93 with an apple pie that can\'t be beat. Lodging accommodations vary and feature views of horses grazing in the back pasture, or sage-covered hills well suited for a trail ride. There are so many activities here you\'ll never run out of things to do. You can choose to ride a horse or splash in the pool. Play tennis, soccer or challenge your traveling companions to a game of horseshoes. Board games make indoor time fun too. And believe it or not, there is one TV at the ranch but according to the ranch hands, there\'s hardly ever a kid in front of it!\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                                Night 7\r\n                                :\r\n                                Adoba Eco Hotel Rapid City\r\n                                - \r\n                                    Rapid City, South Dakota\r\n                                \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdeally located in Rapid City\'s historic downtown district, The Adoba Eco Hotel Rapid City offers warm hospitality, an inviting atmosphere and is ideally located just steps away from popular entertainment options, shopping areas and businesses.

Information on everything from weather to internet connections can be found below.\n\n\nInclusive Prices\n\n\nTour Prices\n\nTour prices are per person in British pound sterling. All hotel accommodations, motor coach transportation, entertainment, special dinners, sightseeing, porterage, and the services of local guides, drivers and the Tauck Director are included. We have arranged with The Driver Provider to provide you with a shared ride van service from Jackson Hole\xc2\xa0Airport to the the Jackson Lake Lodge, provided you have furnished us with accurate flight arrival information at least three weeks before your departure date. We will also provide transportation from the Adoba Eco Hotel to Rapid City Regional Airport, when you check out of the hotel. Transportation to and from airports may be shared with other Tauck guests. \n\nHotel Accommodations\n\r\n                                \r\n                                The tour price includes all hotel accommodations with private baths. Our standard is to provide the best available accommodations without sacrificing value. Although the quality may differ slightly from one hotel to another, our commitment to your comfort is unwavering. Two-bedded rooms are reserved in most hotels. Triples are usually two-bedded rooms plus a rollaway cot and are not recommended for comfort. \n\n\nMeals\n\r\n                                \r\n                                Most meals are included as specified in the itinerary. \n\n\nTauck Director\n\nYellowstone &amp; Grand Teton National Parks is conducted by a Tauck Director who will remain with the group throughout the tour. Your Tauck Director is a professional, fully trained employee of Tauck. \n\n\n\nGratuities Included\n\r\n                                \r\n                                All customary gratuities for hotel and restaurant staff and local guides are included. \n\n\nLuggage Handling and Restrictions\n\nChecked Luggage \xe2\x80\x93 General\xc2\xa0\nDue to space restrictions, we ask that you please limit your checked luggage to one suitcase per person weighing no more than 50 pounds (23 kg) and with overall dimensions (length + width + height) not exceeding 62 inches (158 cm). \n\r\nBesides complying with the Tauck restriction noted above, you should also be sure to research and comply with all airline baggage restrictions relating to your flights to and from your Tauck journey. Airlines have become much more strict in enforcing size and weight limits in recent years, and luggage exceeding airline standards for size or weight may result in expensive overage fees or other consequences.\n\r\nAirlines are free to revise luggage policies without notice, and certain airlines have different baggage allowances for different classes of service. Researching and complying with airline luggage restrictions is the responsibility of the guest, and Tauck cannot be held responsible for any costs or disruptions to travel caused by the failure to research and comply with airline policies.\nPlease be sure to attach your Tauck luggage tag to your suitcase before leaving home! \n\nCarry-on Luggage - General \n\r\nAlthough oversize bags and wheeled, carry-on luggage are popular for airline travel, they are often not convenient or appropriate for motor coach travel or for many on-tour flights. Most modern sightseeing motor coaches offer limited space for numerous or larger items. Space under seats or in the overhead rack is typically small, and designed to accommodate items like coats, hats, purses, and small camera bags, etc. \n\r\nFor your day-to-day travel while on tour, we recommend that you limit your hand luggage to a small, soft-sided carry-on piece, and that you bring only those items you need handy during the day such as make-up, medications, cameras, film, etc. Items too large to fit under the motor coach seat or on the overhead rack must be stored in the luggage bays beneath the motor coach, and may be inaccessible during daytime travel.\n\nNo Options Sold\n\nTauck Directors assist with information on free-time activities based on honest opinion and guidance, but they will not sell you anything. This means better value and a more relaxed and pleasant experience for you.\n\n\n\n\nTravel Documents Required\n\n\nYellowstone &amp; Grand Teton National Parks begins and ends in the U.S. \n\nIf you are a citizen of another country traveling to the U.S., you should contact an embassy or consulate of the U.S. to determine what travel documentation is necessary. You may also log on to the U.S. State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Internet site by clicking here. \n\nIf you are traveling by air to join and/or depart from this tour within the U.S., please read the section entitled Airline Security Measures under Additional Information to determine what travel documentation is required. \n\nIf you are a citizen of the U.S. or Canada who travels frequently between the two countries, you may benefit from the NEXUS program, which is a joint initiative between the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Agency and the Canada Border Services Agency that allows pre-screened and approved travelers faster processing at designated highway lanes in high-volume border crossing locations, at a NEXUS kiosk at several airports, and at certain marine reporting locations in the Great Lakes and Seattle regions. For further information, you may log on to the Nexus Internet website by clicking here. Please note that longer stays abroad for any purpose may require additional travel documentation. \n\r\nWe recommend that you make at least two photocopies of all the travel documents that you bring with you. Include copies of the photo page of your passport that contains the date of issuance, the date of expiration and your citizenship. Secure one set of copies in the safe in your room while traveling and leave one set behind with someone at home who will assist you in the event your documents are misplaced, lost or stolen.\nNote: For activities marked with an asterisk (*) in day-by-day descriptions, participation is at your own risk; a signed liability waiver will be required.\n\r\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot Included\n\n\nTransportation\n\nTransportation to the tour departure point and from the tour ending point is not included.\n\n\nHotel Rooms Before and After Tours\n\nTo avoid jet lag and possible flight delays, you may wish to make hotel arrangements for the nights preceding or following your tour or cruise. As a service, we will book additional nights for you on a space-available basis using special rates only available through us. Hotel room charges will be added to the tour or cruise cost. Train and airport transfers are included for these extended stays as described above under Inclusive Prices. If you wish to spend additional nights, please consult\xc2\xa0Extend Your Trip in the Accommodations section\xc2\xa0on this webpage and discuss it with your reservations sales consultant or your travel agent when you book your tour or cruise.\n\nLuggage Responsibility\n\nAlthough every effort is made to handle your luggage carefully, we cannot be responsible, assume liability or accept claims for loss or damage to luggage and personal effects due to breakage, theft, or fair wear and tear through hotel, airline and group carrier handling. It is important for your own self-interest and protection that you make certain you have adequate insurance to cover these eventualities.\nLost luggage is an unfortunate possibility in today\'s world of airline travel. We suggest that you: \n\nPack at least one change of clothing in your carry-on bag \nSplit your items between your suitcase and a traveling companion\'s suitcase \nDo not pack any vital medications or valuables in your checked luggage \nConfirm that your luggage is checked and tagged to your final destination at airport check-in \nPlace your luggage claim tags in a secure place for your flight \nFile a claim for any missing luggage immediately before leaving the baggage claim area \nSecure a case number and contact information for follow-up communications \nMake certain that the airline has your onward itinerary \n\nYour Tauck Director will assist you with airline and other carrier communications, but has no inside contacts to guarantee or expedite recovery of lost luggage. All recovery costs, including the communication costs, are your responsibility. Check your travel protection details for covered expenses. \n\nPersonal Expenses\n\nPersonal Expenses such as phone calls, room service, alcoholic and other beverages not specifically included, laundry, dry cleaning, airline excess luggage charges, vaccinations, visa fees and services, airport arrival and departure taxes, individual train and airport transfers (when applicable), and other optional or incidental extras are not included and may be significant. \n\n\n\nTauck Director Gratuities\n\r\n                                \r\n                                The customary gratuities for the Tauck Director and local drivers are not included. We ask that gratuities be extended on a voluntary, individual basis and not as a group.                             \r\n                            \n\n\n\nPreparing to Go\n\n\nJourney Start and End Times\n\nJourney Start and End Times are provided at the time of booking. The tour begins at 6:00 PM at the Jackson Lake Lodge on the first day of the tour. You or your booking agent will be advised of any change to this schedule. When you make flight arrangements, please allow sufficient time to claim your luggage and clear customs in order to join the tour on time. The tour ends at the Adoba Eco Hotel. We will also provide transportation to Rapid City Regional Airport, when you check out of the hotel, provided you have furnished us with accurate flight information. Each carrier and each airport has different rules regarding how early you must arrive for flight check in. Please contact your individual carrier for this information. \n\n\n\nHoliday and Museum Closures\n\r\n                                \r\n                                Museum visits and personal shopping time may be disrupted due to unforeseen circumstances or the many state, religious and civic holidays locally observed.

We reserve the right to alter or curtail the itinerary, or substitute sightseeing, hotels, and/or conveyances as deemed necessary. Any savings realized by these changes will be refunded to you. Any resultant added expense will be covered by us. Although not expected, prices on this website may be modified due to unexpected significant external factors not forecast at the time of publication. \n\n\nPhotography On Tour\n\r\n                                \r\n                                Occasionally, we will use photographs and/or video taken by fellow guests or your Tauck Director on your tour for print, Internet and other media promotional purposes. If you prefer that your image not be used in any marketing activities, please notify your Tauck Director at the start of your tour.                             \r\n                            \nMembership\n\nMembership will be granted to all persons. We reserve the right to terminate the tour of any person who is abusive of others or whose behavior disrupts the tour. \n\n\n\nATM and Credit Cards\n\r\n                                \r\n                                We recommend that you contact your bank in advance of departing on this tour to determine whether you will be able to use your ATM and credit cards while traveling. When contacting your bank, notify them of your travel dates so that they will anticipate charges being made outside of your hometown and do not suspend your cards for what may appear to them to be "suspicious" charges. We also recommend that you make a photocopy of the front and back sides of your ATM and credit cards to leave behind with someone at home who will assist you in the event your cards are misplaced, lost or stolen. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCell Phone Usage\n\nWe understand and appreciate the value of instant communication when we travel; it keeps us in touch with friends and family, and it\'s a reassurance in the event of an emergency. However, the use of cell phones can be disruptive to a tour and to other guests who are enjoying their vacation. As a courtesy to others, we ask that you refrain from using your cell phone while on the motor coach, during group functions, when sightseeing and when your Tauck Director is addressing the group as a whole. There will be many opportunities to make and receive calls at times when it does not affect others. \n\r\nPlease contact your cell phone carrier to determine whether your service extends to Utah, Idaho, Wyoming and South Dakota. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth and Activity\n\n\r\n                    To enjoy this tour, you should be in good health and able to walk reasonable distances, often over unpaved and uneven surfaces. Some of the most memorable sightseeing can only be accomplished on foot. The amount of walking you do, however, is at your discretion.\n\r\nThere are no elevators at The Ranch at Ucross or at the Holiday Inn\xc2\xae Cody at Buffalo Bill Village, and while none of the planned activities are especially strenuous or difficult, we urge caution when engaging in activities at high elevations. If you have a heart condition or lung ailment, please consult your physician before you book your trip. \n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: We regret that we\xe2\x80\x99re unable to provide individual assistance to guests with walking difficulties or other personal needs. The responsibility of the Tauck Director who accompanies your trip is to ensure that the larger group enjoys a relaxing and informative journey, and he or she cannot be relied upon to provide ongoing individual assistance to any one guest. Guests requiring such individualized assistance must be accompanied by an able-bodied companion who can provide it. While drinking water is generally safe at all our hotels, bottled water will be available wherever the local water is not fit to drink. We also provide bottled water on the motor coaches. \n\nThe Jackson Lake Lodge, Old Faithful Inn and Lake Yellowstone Hotel are all non-smoking hotels and a very large fine will be assessed if it is determined that anyone has smoked while on property. \n\nPlease check with your health insurance provider to determine whether you are covered while traveling. If you will not be covered under your current policy, we strongly suggest that you arrange for adequate coverage while on tour. \n\r\nIf you have a medical condition that might limit your participation in activities, please consult your physician for pre-departure health advice and notify Tauck as soon as possible, if you have not already done so. We will advise your Tauck Director accordingly. \n\nIf you are a resident of another country traveling to or within the U.S., we suggest that contact your physician, the public health service in your area, or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to obtain information regarding vaccinations and medications for vaccine-preventable diseases and other diseases for which you might be at risk when you reach your destination in the U.S. The Travelers\' Health Section of the CDC website can be reached\xc2\xa0by clicking here. \n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nTravel With Children\n\nAge Recommendations \xe2\x80\x95 Children\xc2\xa08 years of age or older at the time of travel are welcome on this Tauck journey. Based upon our experience with family travelers, we have a minimum recommended age for each journey to encourage comfort and enjoyment for all of our guests. All children must be accompanied on activities by a parent or guardian. At least one guest in the traveling party must be 21 years of age or older in order to make a reservation. \nBabysitting \xe2\x80\x95 Our journeys are designed for adults and children to share the wonder of discovery together. If you require babysitting services, your Tauck Director will put you in contact with the appropriate hotel staff with whom you may make babysitting arrangements. There is usually an additional fee for these services. Many hotels do offer on-site babysitting services; however, babysitting services may not be available at all of our hotels. Please note that our Tauck Directors are not responsible for providing babysitting services.\nSafety and Welfare Responsibility \xe2\x80\x95 We welcome the participation of child travelers on our exciting excursions. If you are traveling with a child on a Tauck journey, you have the sole responsibility for ensuring that that the child with whom you are traveling follows all rules of safety throughout the tour. By traveling with us, you release Tauck, Inc. and our partners of all liability for any risks and/or injuries to the child with whom you are traveling.\nSpecial Travel Documentation for Children \nAuthorization for Travel \nIf you travel into or out of the U.S. with children under the age of 18, you should be aware of the following: because of increasing incidents of child abductions in disputed custody cases and because children are at risk as possible victims of child pornography, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) strongly recommends that unless the child is accompanied by both parents, you should have a notarized note from the child\'s other parent (or, in the case of a child traveling with grandparents, uncles or aunts, sisters or brothers, or friends, a note signed by both parents) stating that the parent(s) not traveling acknowledge that the parent(s), family members, etc. who are traveling into or out of the U.S. with the child have permission to do so. While CBP may not ask to see this documentation, if they do ask, and you do not have it, you may be detained until the circumstances of the child traveling without both parents can be fully assessed. \nIf there is no second parent with legal claims to the child (parent deceased, sole custody, etc.), other relevant paperwork, such as a court decision, birth certificate naming only one parent, or a death certificate, will be useful. \nAuthorization for Emergency Medical Treatment\nIn the unlikely event of a medical emergency, a medical facility will require permission from the child\xe2\x80\x99s parents to provide treatment. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you bring along a letter from both parents (including other pertinent documents as cited above) authorizing emergency medical treatment for their child. \nWe are not responsible for the disruption of travel caused by the improper documentation of any guest, including children traveling without both parents. While there is no definitive format or standard, click here to view a sample letter for guardians or one parent traveling with a child.\n\nAirline Security Measures\n\nIf you are traveling from the U.S., the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requires that your name, as it appears on your domestic or international airline ticket, must precisely match your name as it appears on the government-issued photo ID (i.e., passport or driver\xe2\x80\x99s license) that you present during security screening. The ID name must also match any additional airline data, such as frequent-flyer information. For example, if you present your driver\'s license to security and it says John T. Smith, your ticket must also say John T. Smith, not John Thomas Smith, Jack Smith, or any other variant. Your date-of-birth and gender information provided to the airline must also match your passport. \n\nIf you make your air travel arrangements through us, please ensure that the name you provide us precisely matches your name as shown on the identification you will use while traveling. If you make your own airline reservations, please ensure that the airline has the correct information. \n\nFor more information on the TSA\'s requirements, please visit their website by clicking here. \n\nIf you are traveling from an airport outside the jurisdiction of the U.S., you will need to determine what travel documentation and identification is required for that particular airport. \n\nDue to heightened security regulations, certain items such as a metal nail file, pocketknife, cigarette lighter, or tweezers, and some liquid, gel, or aerosol items may not be permitted in your carry-on luggage. Please call your airline prior to departure to obtain current information on non-permissible carry-on items and recommended airport check-in times. \n\n\n\n\nWhat to Pack\n\n\nBringing the right clothing for your trip is important \xe2\x80\x93 we\xe2\x80\x99ve partnered with New Headings who provide an "easy-to-use, one-stop shop" for your Tauck travel needs, specifically selected for this trip. Click here to visit their site.\nYour journey is designed with leisure in mind. Dress for comfort and convenience with a wardrobe that is adaptable and allows for layering. Generally, during the day, casual, comfortable, cotton clothing is recommended. Cool weather at higher elevations or at night will require warmer, layered clothing. For the welcome and farewell receptions, casual resort wear is appropriate; formal wear is never required. \n\r\nAll of our hotels offer valet laundry service for a fee except for the Old Faithful Inn, Lake Yellowstone Hotel and The Ranch at Ucross. \n\r\nWe recommend that you pack an adequate supply of your prescription medication in its original container to last through your entire journey, together with a copy of your doctor\xe2\x80\x99s prescription or a letter from your health-care provider on office stationery explaining that the medication has been prescribed for you, a list of the generic names of your medication, your travel documents and a change of clothing in your carry-on bag to avoid any inconvenience in the event that your flight or luggage is delayed. \n\r\nThe national park lodges do not have televisions or Internet hook-ups, so bring along a good book to read!\xc2\xa0\n\r\nFollowing is a list of recommended items to pack for your journey to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks: \n\nCasual daytime wear \xe2\x80\x93 shorts, slacks, long and short-sleeved shirts \nSunglasses, sunscreen, hat \nSwimwear \nGym wear \nA light sweater or jacket for higher elevations or a breezy night \nBinoculars \nInsect repellent \nCamera, lenses, batteries, memory cards and/or plenty of film \nLightweight, comfortable, sturdy walking shoes that have already been broken-in \nBattery-operated travel alarm clock \nRain poncho and collapsible umbrella \nZipper-lock bags \nDaypack for camera equipment \nSundries and toiletries that may be difficult to find en route \nCopies of your travel documents that should be secured in the safe in your hotel room while traveling\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nUpon Arrival...\n\n\nAir Conditioning\n\r\n                                \r\n                                The Jackson Lake Lodge, Old Faithful Inn and Lake Yellowstone Hotel are not air-conditioned; the other hotels used on this tour and the motor coaches are air-conditioned. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCurrency and Exchange Rates\n\r\n                                \r\n                                The U.S. dollar (USD) is the unit of currency and is divided into 100 cents. Only major banks exchange foreign currency. ATMs are widespread and credit cards and travelers\xe2\x80\x99 checks are widely accepted. Travelers\xe2\x80\x99 checks should be taken in U.S. dollars to avoid hassles. Banking hours are generally Monday through Friday 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM.\n\r\nTo obtain the most current exchange rates for all national currencies, you may want to check your local newspaper or log on to the website, oanda.com, by clicking here. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nCustoms and Tax-Free Shopping\n\r\n                                \r\n                                Each country we visit has its own customs clearing process. You should familiarize yourself with each country\xe2\x80\x99s specific required declarations before you travel. In general, you are not permitted to bring live plants, fresh fruits and other produce items into most countries. You may find additional information by visiting VisaHQ.com by clicking here. \n\nIf you are not a resident of the United States, you are normally entitled to a duty-free exemption of $100 USD on items that you bring into the U.S. To find out more information on what information must be provided to U.S. Customs and Border Control (CBP) upon entry, please refer to the CBP internet website by clicking here. You should also refer to your own country\xe2\x80\x99s rules and regulations regarding customs and duty-free shopping to ensure compliance upon your return. \n\r\nThe individual states within the U.S. levy sales taxes on consumer goods and services. There is no federal tax similar to the Value Added Tax (VAT) used in other countries that would permit non-residents to obtain refunds of the sales taxes levied by each state. \n\n\nElectrical Current\n\r\n                                \r\n                                The electrical current in the U.S. is 110 V, 60 Hz, AC, which accommodates standard U.S. plugs having either two flat pins or two flat pins and a round grounding pin. If you bring electric devices that are not compatible with this system, you may need to bring the appropriate adapters and converters. \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nInternet Access\n\r\n                                \r\n                                Complimentary basic Internet where available in hotel rooms; service levels are not guaranteed.                             \r\n                            \nTime Zones\n\nAll the areas visited on this journey are located in the U.S. Mountain Time Zone and are 7 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (or Greenwich Mean Time). From early March to early November, these areas switch to Daylight Saving Time and are 6 hours behind. \n\r\nTo determine current time in major cities around the world, we suggest you log on to the website, timeanddate.com, by clicking here. \n\nElevation\n\r\n                                \r\n                                All the hotels on this itinerary are located at high elevations.

The thermal area of Yellowstone was unique.  Nothing can beat coming over the Bighorn Mountains and traveling across the state of Wyoming visiting two ranches.  Also as my husband said, "every American should see Mt. Rushmore". Rob (tour guide) was amazing!!\r\n                        \nMost Memorable Moment:\n\r\n                            All of it.  A life long dream of seeing the Grand Tetons, Yellowstone, Mt. Rushmore and Crazy Horse.

We LOVED it.  The intinerary is well planned with activities/sightseeing, but there is also alone time to do your own thing.  It was also nice not to have to think about tipping and handling luggage from place to place. Tauck made it so easy to relax and have fun.\r\n                        \nMost Memorable Moment:\n\r\n                            The Cody cowboy review sing-a-long.  The show was actually finished for the season, but the tour director was able to arrange a show just for our Tauck group.  It was fantastic!!!  Do not miss it if you are ever in Cody.

The planning and reservations were perfect in every way, and although we were a group of 42, we began to feel like family.

We started in Salt Lake City Utah at the Grand American Hotel.  We then traveled to the with a too short shopping stop in Jackson.  From there to Grand Teton National park.  This is where the Tauck first class travel went awry!  We stayed in a cabin that was hot when we arrived, \r\n                        \nMost Memorable Moment:\n\r\n                            windows that would not open fully and a noisy ceiling fan.  With Tauck we would have expected to stay in the lodge.  Our past two trips to Hawaii and the gold coast were outstanding.  on both of tese trips luggage was handled from the carrousel onward, not on this trip. If we travel on Tauck again we hope that the standrds have not been lowered.\r\n                        \nWould you recommend Tauck to a friend?Maybe\n\nTAUCK RESPONSE\nThanks for sharing your feedback.
