Curry talks Cam Newton, race, Kobe\'s career and Jordan\'s Bulls\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurry says if they have the chance, his Warriors will chase history.\n\n\nNBAE/Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy Brett Pollakoff\n\nFeb 1, 2016 at 3:00p ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0Shares\n\n\n\n\n\nStephen Curry is not only the reigning NBA MVP, but he\'s been even better this season in leading his Warriors to a historically great start to the season. Courtesy of his partnership with Degree and the launch of the\xc2\xa0Degree MotionSense Lab, Curry sat down with FOX Sports to discuss a variety of topics, including Cam Newton\'s criticism, the chase to break the Bulls\' record for most wins in a season, and whether his style of play might allow him to stay in the league as long as Kobe Bryant.\n\n\nFOX Sports: Obviously you guys are on a record-setting pace, and there\'s been a lot of talk about 72-10, chasing the \xe2\x80\x9996 Bulls. Do you guys even talk about that internally? Do players talk about that, do coaches, or is that mostly media and fans who are discussing it?\n\n\nStephen Curry: We talk about it because we\xe2\x80\x99re asked about it, mostly. We\xe2\x80\x99re not afraid to address it and understand the opportunity we have, obviously with the 24-0 start. We\xe2\x80\x99re on pace for it, or actually I think we\xe2\x80\x99re one game ahead of that pace.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\nSo we know where we are, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to fast-forward to April and really kind of get your mind to where, we\xe2\x80\x99re 28 games from tying the record. It just makes it sink in how hard and how special that accomplishment was for the Bulls. We\xe2\x80\x99re obviously worried about what happens in the playoffs, and being healthy and full-strength playing our best come April 16 or whenever our last game is.\xc2\xa0\n\n\nBut if we have an opportunity to go for it, we\xe2\x80\x99ll go for it. Because how many chances are you going to get to be a team that passes that record, and obviously everybody\xe2\x80\x99s still talking about the 95-96 Bulls \xe2\x80\x94 one, because of their record, and two, because they finished it off with a championship. We want to be able to do both, too.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFS: You guys got off to that hot start with Steve Kerr sidelined. I know he was around behind the scenes, and you were still running his systems and he was around a little bit at practices. But for fans that don\xe2\x80\x99t really know exactly what he brings, what\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest difference having him back on the bench for you guys?\n\n\nSC: He just has a presence that we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to kind of expect every night. He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty fiery. He has a high standard that we have to meet regardless of what our record is. [Sunday night] he broke the white board during the first quarter because we were playing like trash, pretty much.\xc2\xa0\n\n\nIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter what our record is or how great we\xe2\x80\x99ve been playing up until that point, we still have to keep a level of focus. And if we\xe2\x80\x99re not meeting that, he\xe2\x80\x99s quick to tell us. It is obviously his system and his vision for our team, and coach Walton did a great job of amplifying that while he was gone. But when you have your general running the show, it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely more comfortable for us.\n\n\nFS: Obviously your Panthers are in the Super Bowl, wanted to ask you a little bit about Cam Newton. You\xe2\x80\x99re the reigning MVP in the NBA, he\xe2\x80\x99s on track to win it this year in the NFL. But in the media, you guys are portrayed very differently. He\xe2\x80\x99s criticized for what seems like nonsense, but you get almost universally positive coverage. Why do you think that is?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCHARLOTTE, NC - JANUARY 17: Cam Newton #1 of the Carolina Panthers shows his trademark "dab" against the Seattle Seahawks in the 2nd quarter during the NFC Divisional Playoff Game at Bank of America Stadium on January 17, 2016 in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images)\n\nGrant Halverson\n\n\n\n\nSC: I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. He\xe2\x80\x99s addressed it a lot actually, and I respect him for standing up and answering those questions for sure. Obviously there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of talk about race and just his uniqueness as a player. And there\xe2\x80\x99s so much scrutiny for the quarterback position in football in general. But the way he plays the game is so much fun to watch \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s smiling, he\xe2\x80\x99s joking, he\xe2\x80\x99s laughing, he has a flair about him. And obviously when he\xe2\x80\x99s dancing in the end zone and all that, he\xe2\x80\x99s not the first person to do it, he won\xe2\x80\x99t be the last person to do it.\xc2\xa0\n\n\nThe unwarranted scrutiny, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know really what the root of it is, but the fact that he continues to be himself despite whatever anybody might say, or any letter that a fan might write about why he\xe2\x80\x99s dancing in the end zone, dabbing or whatever. He takes it well, and continues to be himself and just plays the game and has fun doing what he does. I try to keep that same mentality, regardless of if there\xe2\x80\x99s praise or scrutiny.\n\n\nFS: There\xe2\x80\x99s been guys recently that were tagged with the best player in the game label that were polarizing. Kobe Bryant, obviously, for a lot of reasons. LeBron, when he left Cleveland the first time. What do you think you would have to do to sort of get that polarizing label, because again, fans don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you, there\xe2\x80\x99s no negative narratives written about you. Is there anything you could do to sort of become a villain in the league?\n\n\nSC: I have no idea (laughs). It\xe2\x80\x99s funny now how certain just off-the-cuff comments or whatever, even in the last month, started headlines. Me talking about the Super Bowl, we have a game Saturday and they have a game Sunday, I said hopefully it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a great 48 hours, a win and a win for us and the Panthers. That became a \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee\xe2\x80\x9d that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to beat OKC, and this and that. The position I\xe2\x80\x99m in, whatever I say is going to be analyzed and all that kind of stuff, which is fine by me. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what it\xe2\x80\x99d take to be a polarizing figure. I just try to be myself and enjoy what I do. You can\xe2\x80\x99t really control that stuff, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no point in wasting energy on it.\n\n\nFS: Kobe Bryant\xe2\x80\x99s now in his 20th NBA season, and obviously he\xe2\x80\x99s retiring after this season. Do you see yourself having that type of longevity assuming you stay healthy? And then, if so, do you think the way that you play the game now would translate over that type of time period, or would you have to adjust some of the things that you do to stay in the league that long?\n\n\nSC: I want to play that long. My dad has kind of been the standard for me, he played 16 years in the league, and since I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in the league, every year that I go through and deal with the scratches, the bumps and bruises, just the grind that it is to go through one NBA season.\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have such a respect for those guys that play that long into their careers, because there\xe2\x80\x99s just so much that you go through. So, for Kobe to be, one with the same team for 20 years, and two, to play 20 years is pretty remarkable. I would love to be one of those guys. Being able to shoot the ball will hopefully allow me to have that longevity, [as well as] being able to handle the ball. Obviously quickness and speed might deteriorate as you go through your career, but I think the way that I play the game will last a good while. I won\xe2\x80\x99t have to do any major changes to continue my career a long way, hopefully. Just hopefully stay healthy, and be able to help a team out as I go through and still play at a pretty high level.\n\n\nFS: We\xe2\x80\x99ve got All-Star weekend coming up, are you planning on defending your three-point shootout title?\n\n\nSC: Most likely. I\xe2\x80\x99ve done it three straight years and finally won one. Knowing I\xe2\x80\x99ll be there already, I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably suit up Saturday night and see if I can defend it. It\xe2\x80\x99s a gym I\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten a lot of shots up in growing up, with my dad playing up there for three years. So, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a pretty special spot to lace \xe2\x80\x98em up and shoot some threes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0Shares\n\n\n\n\n\nGolden State Warriors\nStephen Curry\nNBA\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the new FOX Sports App to get the latest news and scores from your NBA team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nView Comments \n\n\n\nHide Comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{\n\n"meta" : {\n\t"title":"Steph Curry talks Cam Newton, race, Kobe\'s career and Jordan\'s Bulls | FOX Sports",\n\t"url":"http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview-020116",\n\t"fileName": "/content/fsdigital/fscom/nba/story/2016/02/01/stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview",\n\t"isRedirect": "false",\n\t"canonical":"http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview-020116",\n\t"refreshRate":"none"\n},\n"og" : {\n\t"title":"Steph Curry talks Cam Newton, race, Kobe&#39;s career and Jordan&#39;s Bulls | FOX Sports",\n\t"url":"http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview-020116",\n\t"description":"Stephen Curry talks Cam Newton, Kobe\'s longevity and Jordan\'s Bulls",\n\t"image":"http://a.fssta.com/content/dam/fsdigital/fscom/NBA/images/2016/01/18/011816-NBA-Stephen-Curry-LN-PI.vresize.1200.675.high.29.jpg",\n\t"site_name":"FOX Sports"\n},\n"ads" : {\n\t"adUnitNamePrefix":"t-",\n\t"dfpRootNode": "fscom",\n\t"refreshRate": "0",\n\t"intervalID" : "",\n    "networkId": "20893548",\n    "pagePath": "/fscom/nba/story",\n\t"pageTargeting": [{\n\t\t"author": ["brett pollakoff"],\n\t\t"contenttype":["story"],\n\t\t"source": ["fox sports"],\t\t\n\t\t"tags": ["nba,publishthis,priority,nba_21,brett_pollakoff,nba_1550,home,nba"],\n\t\t"test":[""]\n\n\t\t}]\n},\n\n"analytics" : {\n    "data" : {\n        "account" : "foxsports",\n        "page_name": "fscom:nba:story:story page",\n        "page_type": "story page",\n        "category": "nba",\n        "utags": "nba|publishthis|priority|nba-21|brett-pollakoff|nba-1550|home|nba",\n        "cms_id" : "12121",\n        "page_topic": "sports:basketball/leagues/nba,internal:dev/publishthis,internal:newsletter/priority,sports:basketball/teams/0/0/1/nba-21,internal:newsletter/brett-pollakoff,sports:basketball/players/0/3/0/nba-1550,internal:Editorial/section-fronts/home,internal:Editorial/section-fronts/nba",\n        "filename": "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview-020116",\n        "story_title" : "stephen-curry-warriors-bulls-72-10-cam-newton-criticism-playing-as-long-as-kobe-interview",\n        "source" : "fox sports",\n        "publish_date": "02/01/2016",\n\t\t"author": "Brett Pollakoff",\n        "story_position" : "",\n        "user_state" : "",\n        "analyticsRefreshRate": "0",\n        "testStoryPageDesign": "A",\n        "testScorestripPosition": "null",\n        "testGalleryPageDesign": "null"\n\n    }, \n     "url" : "//tags.tiqcdn.com/utag/foxsports/main/prod/utag.js"\n},\n\n\n\n\n"mode" : "rendered",\n"layout" : "regular-sidebar",\n"className" : "story-page show-page st-foxbox-shut",\n"disableAnalytics" :  "0",  \n"page-design" :{\n\t"path" : "/bin/platform/tag/theme.dynamictag.css?tag=sports:basketball/leagues/nba&template=story&fsv=201602112300",\n\t"name" : "story-nba",\n\t"clientLib" : "",\n\t"isTag": false\n},\n"video" : {\n\t"playerScript": ""\n},\n"site-promos" : {},\n\n"authentication" : {}, \n"staticAssetDomain":"http://a.fssta.com",\n"foxbox" : {"activated": "true", "url": "", "isBig" : "false" },\n"staticAssetDomain":"http://a.fssta.com",\n\n"tv-listings" : {},\n"social" : {}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry talks Cam Newton, race, Kobe\'s career and Jordan\'s Bulls\n\nUP NEXT :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteph Curry talks Cam Newton, race, Kobe\'s career and Jordan\'s Bulls\n\nUP NEXT :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFOXSports.com &gt;\n\nWriters |\nContact Us |\nPress |\nJobs |\nRSS |\nSitemap\n\n\n\nFollow FOX Sports &gt;\n\nFacebook |\nTwitter |\nInstagram |\nYouTube |\nTumblr\n\n\n\nOther FOX Sites &gt;\n\nFS1 |\nFOX |\nFOX News |\n21st Century Fox |\nFOX Sports Supports |\nFOX Deportes\n\n\n\nPartners &gt;\n\nShop |\nTickets\n\n\nStatistical Information provided by: STATS LLC\n\xc2\xa92016 Fox Sports Interactive Media, LLC.
