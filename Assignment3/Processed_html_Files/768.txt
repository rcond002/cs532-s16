If your phone is running\n\t\t\t\tWindows Phone 8, some options and icons may look a little different, and some\n\t\t\t\tfeatures may not be available. Check to see\n\t\t\t\twhich software\n\t\t\t\tversion you have and\n\t\t\t\tfind out\n\t\t\t\tif an update is available. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tNarrator, browser caption customization, and other accessibility\n\t\t\t\tfeatures may not be available in your country or region. For more info, see\n\t\t\t\tFeature and\n\t\t\t\tservice availability. \n\t\t\t \n\nThe ease of access settings screen\n\nTo change the text size\nYou can choose from a range of text sizes for your phone. The text size you choose will show up in email, messaging, your lock screen, some webpages, and some other places.\n\nIn the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\n\nUnder Text size, move the slider until the sample text size is the size you want. \n\n\n\nTo use a high-contrast theme\nHigh contrast makes everything easier to read by changing text to black and white and providing a solid background behind words that would otherwise be on top of pictures.\n\nIn the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\n\nTurn on High contrast .\n\n\n Tips\n\n\n\t\t\t\tYou can also choose a theme color for the phone that provides\n\t\t\t\thigher contrast on its own. The highest contrast theme is the dark background\n\t\t\t\twith yellow accent. To change the accent color, go to Settings\n\t\t\t\t &gt; Start + theme. \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\tTo change the color scheme for the calendar, in the\n\t\t\t\tApp\n\t\t\t\tlist, tap Calendar \n\t\t\t\t&gt; More \nSettings. Then, for each calendar, select the color you want to\n\t\t\t\tuse. \n\t\t\t  \n\nThe Start screen with high contrast turned on\nTo turn on NarratorNarrator reads aloud text on your phone, including the text found in emails, text messages, settings, and more. For more information on how to use this feature, including a full list of Narrator-specific gestures, see Use Narrator on my phone.In the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.Turn on Narrator .\nNote\n\n\n\t\t\t Narrator is only available on Windows Phone 8.1. \n\t\t  \n\nTip\n\n\n\t\t\t Turn on Narrator quick launch and you\'ll be able to turn Narrator on\n\t\t\t or off with a quick button combo\xe2\x80\x94press and hold the Volume\n\t\t\t Up button, and then press the\n\t\t\t Start\n\t\t\t button. \n\t\t  \n\n\nTo magnify the screen\nThe screen magnifier lets you use gestures to enlarge any screen you\'re viewing.\n\nIn the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\n\nTurn on Screen magnifier .\n\nOn any screen, double-tap with two fingers to magnify it. Once it\'s magnified, you can try the following:\nTo move around the entire screen (even the parts that aren\'t showing because you\'re zoomed in), use two fingers to single-tap and hold anywhere on the screen, then pan in any direction.To change the zoom level while the screen is magnified, use two fingers to double-tap and hold, then pan up or down to increase or decrease magnification.To scroll up or down while the screen is magnified, first pan to the edge of the screen. Once you reach the edge, you can scroll as you normally would by swiping or panning with one finger.\n\nTip\n\nIt can be tricky to get the hang of the two-finger double-tap. If it\'s not working for you right away, try angling your fingers so they aren\'t too far apart, and so they both touch your phone at the same time.\n\n\n\n\nTo zoom on any web contentYou can set your phone to zoom in or out on any webpage, even if a site or app doesn\'t normally let you.In the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\nTurn on Allow zooming on all web content .\nOn any webpage, spread your thumb and forefinger apart to zoom in or pinch them together to zoom out.\n\nTo turn on more options for Speech\nYou can make calls, search the web, open apps, or listen to text messages with Speech, and turn on more features that help you use your phone hands-free or even eyes-free, like talking caller ID for phone calls. For more, see Use Speech on my phone.\n\nIn the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\n\nTurn on Speech for phone accessibility .\n\nTip\n\nIn Windows Phone 8, you can find the instructions for using these Speech features on your phone by tapping Help  after Speech opens. In Windows Phone 8.1, just say "Help" any time while Speech is active to display some examples of how to use it.\n\n\n\n\n Notes\n  If you use Cortana, you can still use Speech in the same ways\n\t\t  mentioned above.  Cortana is only available on\n\t\t  Windows Phone 8.1.\n\nTo customize browser captions (video closed captioning)You can customize the  appearance of captions for videos in Internet Explorer and apps that use the browser to display content. Change the font size and color, background transparency, and more until it\'s just how you want it.\nIn the App list, tap Settings  &gt; Ease of access.\nTap Browser captions, then turn on Custom fonts and colors .Tap each option to change your font, text, background, and window preferences.Note\n\t\t\t\tBrowser caption customization is only available on Windows Phone 8.1.
