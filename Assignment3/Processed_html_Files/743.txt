This is a text field where you can enter words and phrases about what you want to do next and quickly get to features you want to use or actions you want to perform. You can also use Tell Me to find help about what you\'re looking for, or to use Smart Lookup to research or define the term you entered. \n\n\n\n\n\nWork together in real time\nIf you store your document online at OneDrive or SharePoint, and then share it with colleagues who use Word 2016 or Word Online, you can see each others\' changes to the document as they happen. After you save the document online, click Share to generate a link or an email invitation. When your teammates open the document and agree to automatically share changes, you\'ll see their work in real time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo learn how to collaborate in Word 2016, see Collaborate on Word documents with real-time co-authoring.\n\n\nInsights into what you\'re working on\nSmart Lookup, powered by Bing, brings research directly into your Word 2016. When you select a word or phrase, right-click it, and choose Smart Lookup, the Insights pane opens with definitions, Wiki articles, and top related searches from the web.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk equations\nIncluding math equations has gotten much easier. Now you can go to Insert &gt; Equation &gt; Ink Equation any time you want to include a complex math equation in your document. If you have a touch device, you can use your finger or a touch stylus to write math equations by hand, and Word 2016 will convert it to text. (If you don\'t have a touch device, you can use a mouse to write, too). You can also erase, select, and correct what you\'ve written as you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved version history\nNow you can go to File &gt; History to see a complete list of changes that have been made to your document and to access earlier versions. \n\n\nSimpler sharing\nClick Share to share your document with others on SharePoint, OneDrive, or OneDrive for Business, or to send a PDF or copy as an email attachment, directly from Word.\n\n\n\nFor the details, see Share your document in Word 2016 for Windows.\n\n\nFaster shape formatting\nWhen you insert shapes from the Shapes gallery, you can choose from a collection of preset fills as well as theme colors to quickly get the look you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies To: Word 2016\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\xef\xbb\xbf\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nHow can we improve it?\n255 characters remaining\n\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include contact information in your feedback.
