So when NBC\xe2\x80\x99s Chuck Todd asked which priority would go first under a Sanders or Clinton administration, both candidates refused to even answer the question.\nMrs. Clinton explicitly said she rejected his premise, saying that she would seek to achieve all of her goals, without accepting the idea of prioritizing one over the other. Mr. Sanders essentially took the same position. He said he supported comprehensive immigration changes, for example, but also said he would push for a  campaign finance overhaul.\nMr. Todd pushed both candidates to see if they would acknowledge that they might not get everything done. Neither one would accept that possibility. Not on live T.V., anyway.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11:05 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T04:07:47+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhotoHillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders had moments of common ground among their differences on the issues.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:57 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T04:04:49+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton Is for Things \nI\xe2\x80\x99m for a lot of things.

That reality was on display in the second hour of the Democratic debate, as both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton stayed silent when they might have done otherwise. \nWhen moderators raised with Mrs. Clinton the issue of her emails as secretary of state, she aggressively defended herself, calling it an \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd situation\xe2\x80\x9d that involved retroactive classification of material. Asked to comment, Mr. Sanders simply said: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a process underway. I will not politicize it.\xe2\x80\x9d With Mrs. Clinton smiling, Mr. Sanders went a step further. \n\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s not a day that goes by when I\xe2\x80\x99m not asked to attack her on that issue and I have refrained from doing that and I will continue to refrain,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\nMrs. Clinton returned the favor a minute later when the moderators quizzed Mr. Sanders on several questionable actions by his campaign staff. Like his rival, Mr. Sanders defended himself before the question was put to Mrs. Clinton for a response. Do you want to jump in, she was asked? \n\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d she said simply.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:50 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:50:12+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhotoHillary Clinton and Senator Bernie SandersCredit Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:44 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:47:30+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders on the Death Penalty \nI just don\xe2\x80\x99t want to see government be part of killing.\n\xe2\x80\x94 Senator Bernie Sanders, on the death penalty.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:43 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:45:49+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhotoHillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders differed on what it means to be progressive.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:39 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:51:47+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders on Newspaper Endorsements, or Blah Blah Blah Blahs \nWe never said, never said, that somebody, a newspaper endorsed us that did not.

But the two have differences on foreign policy, too, and Mrs. Clinton seemed eager to highlight what she called concerns about the knowledge and understanding that Mr. Sanders has about foreign policy.\nMrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of saying that Iranian troops should move into Syria to help fight against the Islamic State, and she said he wanted Saudi Arabia and Iran \xe2\x80\x94 two archenemies \xe2\x80\x94 to work together. \n\xe2\x80\x9cI do think questions have been raised and questions have to be answered,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s positions on foreign policy. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no way to predict what comes into the door of that White House from day to day.\xe2\x80\x9d She called it \xe2\x80\x9ca big part of the job interview.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Sanders was quick to concede that Mrs. Clinton has more foreign policy experience. But he once again said that judgment about foreign events was also critical, and he repeated his criticism that Mrs. Clinton supported the war against Iraq in 2002. \nThat issue from 14 years ago has become one of the most central disagreements between the two on foreign policy, even as they play down the disagreements on current questions about what to do in the fight against extremism today.\n\xe2\x80\x9cOne of us voted the right way and one of us didn\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sanders said to Mrs. Clinton, referring to the Iraq war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:15 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:33:12+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders on Foreign Threats \nRussia lives in the world.

But on Thursday, Mr. Sanders repeatedly avoided doubling down on that line of attack.\nHe punted when Mrs. Clinton challenged him to state the charge directly. Instead of mentioning the speeches, Mr. Sanders railed against Wall Street and the role of political contributions. Later, when the debate moderators again brought up the speeches that Mrs. Clinton gave, Mr. Sanders again declined to seize on it.\nMrs. Clinton said she would \xe2\x80\x9clook into\xe2\x80\x9d the possibility of releasing transcripts of all of the speeches, giving Mr. Sanders an opening to demand that she do so. Instead, when the questioners came to him, Mr. Sanders ignored the issue of her speeches and returned to his criticism of Wall Street.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIn my view, the business model of Wall Street is flawed, is flawed,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that corruption is rampant.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMr. Clinton jumped in quickly, saying that she, too, cares \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply\xe2\x80\x9d about the issue of Wall Street power. But it was clear she appeared relieved to have dodged a more direct clash with Mr. Sanders over the issue of the paid speeches.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10:01 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T03:02:22+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton on ISIS \nA vote in 2002 is not a plan to defeat ISIS.

His own voice rising, too, Mr. Sanders asked whether Wall Street deregulation might have had something to do with political contributions.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSome people might think it had some influence,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, sarcastically, drawing big applause from the audience.\nThe exchange highlights one of the key differences between the two Democratic candidates: the connection to different parts of the party\xe2\x80\x99s core constituency. Mr. Sanders has questioned his rival\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to progressive, liberal Democrats, while Mrs. Clinton accuses Mr. Sanders of failing to show how he could really make progress.\nIt is a fundamental division \xe2\x80\x94 and it quickly became obvious in the debate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:33 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T02:33:41+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton Accuses Bernie Sanders of \xe2\x80\x98Artful Smear\xe2\x80\x99 \nIf you\xe2\x80\x99ve got something to say, say it directly, but you will not find that I ever changed a view or a vote because of any donation that I ever received.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Hillary Clinton, accusing Bernie Sanders of a \xe2\x80\x9cvery artful smear\xe2\x80\x9d based on donors to her campaign. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:27 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T02:32:36+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael D. Shear\n \n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton Clash on Health Care \n\n\nPhoto: Todd Heisler/The New York Times; Video: By MSNBC\n\nHealth care has become almost as contentious in the Democratic primary as it has been for the last several years between Democrats and Republicans in Washington. It became the first point of tension between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton on Thursday night.\nMrs. Clinton is eager to cast her rival as willing to push aside President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Affordable Care Act while he seeks a single-payer plan similar to those in many European nations. In the first few minutes, she went on the attack. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not going to wait and have us plunge back into a contentious national debate that has very little chance of succeeding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.\nMr. Sanders quickly took offense, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cit is just not accurate\xe2\x80\x9d that he would dismantle the current health care system while he tries to put in place something better. He praised Obamacare but said it had not done enough to deal with 29 million people without insurance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:26 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T02:28:52+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nPhotoSenator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton went head-to-head in a debate for the first time on Thursday night.Credit Todd Heisler/The New York Times\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9:26 pm ET\nFeb 4, 2016\n2016-02-05T02:36:13+00:00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBernie Sanders on Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s Endorsements \nYes, Secretary Clinton does represent the establishment.
