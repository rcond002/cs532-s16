When you attach files from OneDrive, OneDrive for Business or SharePoint, you can share them as View only, or give the recipients Edit permissions, which helps them collaborate easily on one copy that everyone works on. \n\n\n\nFor more information, see Attach a file to an email in Outlook 2016.\n\n\nOutlook 2016 Groups (Office 365 work or school account)\nWith Outlook 2016 you can use Groups instead of distribution lists to communicate and collaborate with your team members. \nGroups are the better way to collaborate because: \n\n\nYou can create groups with a few clicks and organize them around topics and conversations to work with your teams.\n\n\nWith Groups in Outlook 2016, teams now have a shared place for all their email conversations with full history, allowing teams to engage with members right from the Group\xe2\x80\x99s inbox, create team events, join existing Groups or create new ones.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a group as a favorite just like a folder. Adding a group as a favorite gives you full access to conversation history when you are offline. \n\n\n\n\n\nGet access to past conversations and history for Groups you have joined or added as a member.\n\n\nWithin the Groups shared space, messages are grouped together for each conversation to facilitate quick communication with your team.  You can "Like" a message within a conversation and post a quick reply to have a quick back and forth conversations with your team. \nYou can also receive social notifications in Outlook when someone "Likes" your message. \n\n\nSchedule meetings on a group calendar that everyone in group can update.\n\n\nYou can access a group\xe2\x80\x99s conversation in your Inbox by subscribing to a group. This makes it behave like a distribution list. You can also unsubscribe at any time. \n\n\nManage groups from Outlook by adding or removing members. \n\n\nFor information about how to create a Group, see Create a group in Outlook 2016. Make sure to check the topics at the bottom of that article to learn about joining and managing groups, as well as other features.\n\n\nSearch\nOutlook 2016 email search is faster, more reliable and provides improved performance. You can seamlessly search email across your local computer, Exchange 16 server or Office 365 Mailbox.\nOutlook makes it easier to find email by offering keyword and people suggestions based on your mailbox content from Exchange 2016.  You can quickly find email from someone that you\'ve been exchanging emails with or a project you\xe2\x80\x99re working on. Simply start typing someone\'s name or a keyword in the search box to see suggestions from Exchange 2016.\n\n\nUse Clutter to sort low priority messages\nClutter helps you move low priority messages out of your Inbox so that you can easily scan for important messages. Clutter analyzes your emails, and based on your past behavior, determines the messages that you\xe2\x80\x99re most likely to ignore. It then automatically moves those messages to a folder called Clutter so that you can review them later.\nYou can even help Clutter learn your preferences faster by manually moving items in or out of the Clutter folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If you bought Office 2016 for Windows as a one-time purchase, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an Office 365 subscription, you won\xe2\x80\x99t have access to some features, such as Clutter.  Going forward, there will be regular updates with new features where you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to have an Office 365 subscription to use them.\nFor more information, see Use Clutter to sort low priority messages in Outlook.\n\n\nNew Chinese and Japanese Default Fonts\nIn Office 2016, existing Japanese and Simplified Chinese fonts have been updated with a Unified modern look and feel across the primary authoring apps: Excel, Word, PowerPoint, Outlook Mail and OneNote.\n\n\nEAI (Email Address Internationalization)\nEAI is a Outlook 2016 feature that enables you to send mail to, or receive mail from any email addresses regardless of the language of the email address. International addresses work just like English email addresses, so you reply, send, and compose emails the same way. \nIf you own international email addresses, you can configure them and use all the features of Outlook 2016. Office 365 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t support creation of international address at the time of the release of Outlook 2016. However, if you\'re an Office 365 user, you can send mail to and receive email from any international address. We recommend that you use Unicode Outlook data files (pst and ost files) when using EAI. \n\n\nTell Me\nTell Me brings features and help topics  to your fingerprints, and saves you the time you would normally use to look for a specific function on the Ribbon. You can type what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for in the Tell Me what you want to do box at the top of the Ribbon, and see results as soon as you start typing. Every keystroke refines the results so that you can choose what you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for as soon as you see it. It will also give you the option to read help topics on the feature you\'re looking for, if you need more information.\n\n\n\nFor example, type Reading in the box and Tell Me  will bring back the Reading Pane command, which lets you choose your reading pane options. Or try typing Print and choose one of the options. \n\n\n\nWhen you click in the Tell Me box, you\'ll also see a list of the last five commands you ran from within Tell Me, saving you time getting to the feature you want faster. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies To: Outlook 2016, Office 365\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\xef\xbb\xbf\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nHow can we improve it?\n255 characters remaining\n\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include contact information in your feedback.
