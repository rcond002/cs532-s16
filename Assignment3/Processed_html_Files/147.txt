What do I get when I subscribe?\n\nAn unlimited New York Times digital subscription provides ongoing access to NYTimes.com from any computer or\n            device, as well as access to apps on portable devices. When you subscribe, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get access to\n            articles and blog posts, as well as video, slide shows and other multimedia features.\n\nCan I get a subscription to NYTimes.com only?\n\nNo. A digital subscription package gives you ongoing access to NYTimes.com on any computer or device, plus\n            NYTimes apps for your smartphone and/or tablet, depending on the option you choose.\n\nI get home delivery of the newspaper. Do I get free access?\n\nYes. Print subscribers to The New York Times get a free All Digital Access subscription. This package\n            includes free, unlimited access to NYTimes.com on any device, as well as the full range of NYTimes apps for\n            your smartphone (iPhone\xc2\xae, BlackBerry\xc2\xae, Windows\xc2\xae Phone, AndroidTM-powered phones) and your tablet\n            (iPad\xc2\xae and Android-powered tablets). Print subscribers can share All Digital\n            Access with a family member. Free, unlimited access is provided to all print subscribers, no matter what\n            type of subscription you have (daily, weekday, Weekender, etc.). You\xe2\x80\x99ll also qualify for free digital\n            access if your home delivery is provided by a third party (rather than by The New York Times directly).\n            NYTimes home delivery subscriptions do not include e-reader editions, Times Insider content or digital\n            versions of The New York Times Crossword.\nTo activate your digital subscription, you\xe2\x80\x99ll need to connect your home delivery subscription to your\n            NYTimes.com account. If you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already done so, visit this page to connect your accounts.\n\nDo you offer education and corporate discounts?\n\nYes. Our seat and site license programs allow schools, organizations and corporations to purchase digital\n            access for multiple users at a group discount. To learn more, email groupsubs@nytimes.com\n            or contact\n                us online.\nWe also offer individual subscriptions at a discounted education rate. To learn more, click here.\n\nCan I give a gift subscription to The Times?\n\nYes. To give unlimited access to NYTimes.com and NYTimes apps for as low as $30, click here.\n\nWhat is the cancellation and refund policy?\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time. When you cancel, we will stop charging your account the\n            following billing cycle. Each billing cycle is four weeks, so your unlimited access will continue for the\n            remainder of the current four-week period.\nView the full cancellation and refund policy &gt;&gt;\n\nWhat if I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to subscribe \xe2\x80\x94 can I still read NYTimes.com for free?\n\nVisitors can enjoy 10 free articles (including blog posts, slide shows and other multimedia features) each\n            calendar month on NYTimes.com, as well as unrestricted access to browse the home page, section fronts, blog\n            fronts and classifieds. Your free, limited access resets every month: at the beginning of each calendar\n            month, you\xe2\x80\x99ll once again be able to view 10 free articles for that month.\nNYTimes apps are free to download and install. After downloading an app, you can read 10 articles each month\n            for free. At the beginning of each calendar month, another 10 articles will be available for free.\nFor nonsubscribers, articles from the New York\n            Times archives from 1923 through 1980 are $3.95 each. Views of archived articles outside that date range\n            are free but still count toward the 10-article monthly limit.\n\n\nView our complete FAQ \xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopyright\xc2\xa9\xc2\xa02014\nThe New York Times Company\nPrivacy Policy\nContact\n            Us\nFeedback\n\nHelp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    /*globals $,setTimeout,NYTD.EventTracker*/\n    //ET tracking\n    var runWhenReady = function (testFunction, inFunction, mlsecs, reps) {\n        setTimeout(function z() {\n            if (testFunction()) {\n                inFunction();\n            } else if (--reps) {\n                setTimeout(z, mlsecs);\n            }\n        }, mlsecs);\n    };\n\n    var trackET = function (dataObj, config) {\n        dataObj = dataObj || {};\n        runWhenReady(function () {\n            return (window.NYTD && NYTD.EventTracker && NYTD.EventTracker().track);\n        }, function () {\n            NYTD.EventTracker().track(dataObj, config);\n        }, 100, 50);\n    };\n    //NATIVE\n    $(\'.link-deets\').on("click", function () {\n        var this_linkID = $(\'this\').attr(\'ID\');\n        if ((\'this_linkID\').indexOf(\'smart\') > -1) {\n            eventName: "Bundle A (smartphone and web)"\n        } else if ((\'this_linkID\').indexOf(\'tablet\') > -1) {\n            eventName: "Bundle B (tablet and web)"\n        } else if ((\'this_linkID\').indexOf(\'ada\') > -1) {\n            eventName: "Bundle D (All digital access)"\n        }\n        trackET({\n            contentCollection: "",//adxCampaignName\n            subject: "page",\n            module: "MarketingLP",\n            pgtype: "E-Commerce",\n            action: "Click",\n            region: "1",\n            contentPlacement: "1",\n\n        }, {\n            buffer: false\n        });\n    });\n\n    /* END OF globals $,setTimeout,NYTD.EventTracker*/\n\n\n\n\n'
