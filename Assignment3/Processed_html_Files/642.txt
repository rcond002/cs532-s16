MacFarquhar \nShare\nTweet\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\nTable of Contents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou guys have to ask yourself as cooks, how bad do you want this?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said to his staff. \xe2\x80\x9cLife and death is what it means to me.\xe2\x80\x9d \nCredit Photograph by Platon\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\nSo Pete, let\xe2\x80\x99s just fucking bang out these recipes,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll get fish in tomorrow and start playing around,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \xe2\x80\x9cFish is easy. I know you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, but you can use the buttermilk with the stabilizer and whip it so it\xe2\x80\x99s like yogurt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking a spicy buttermilk. Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it the consistency of the tofu.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDoesn\xe2\x80\x99t Jean Georges have that fluke with a buttermilk dressing and champagne grapes?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fucking badass, over fluke.\xe2\x80\x9d  David Chang and Peter Serpico were sitting in the basement office of Momofuku Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar, going over what they had to get done before the opening of Ko. The stoves were in, and the gas was ready to be turned on, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cook there yet, because the fire-extinguishing system wasn\xe2\x80\x99t installed. Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar was Chang\xe2\x80\x99s second restaurant; Ko was his third.  Chang is only thirty, but in the past couple of years he has unexpectedly and, in his mind, accidentally and probably fraudulently, become one of the most celebrated chefs in the country. He is way too neurotic to handle this, however, so he compensates by representing himself as a bumbling idiot. He is five feet ten, built like a beer mug, and feels that most food tastes better with pork.  Serpico is Ko\xe2\x80\x99s chef. He has worked with Chang for a couple of years, after a job at Bouley. He and Chang both raze their hair to buzz cuts, but while Chang\xe2\x80\x99s makes his head look rounder and more baby-like, Serpico\xe2\x80\x99s makes him look sharper, wirier, ready to flee.  \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., the one thing we don\xe2\x80\x99t have down and standardized is scallops, which we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do right now.\xe2\x80\x9d They\xe2\x80\x99d been working on the scallop dish for weeks. It was a thing of beauty: a smear of black nori pur\xc3\xa9e on the bottom of the bowl; then a layer of sea scallops and chanterelles and possibly clams; and then, spooned on top in front of the customer, a soft heap of foaming dashi (kelp and dried-bonito broth), made intentionally unstable with just a little methylcellulose, so that in front of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s eyes the bubbles would burst and dissipate into a fishy liquid, at exactly the speed that foam from a wave dissipates onto sand. It looked like the sea and tasted like the sea, and Chang was extremely proud of it. The only thing he was worried about was the word \xe2\x80\x9cfoam,\xe2\x80\x9d which, owing to its trendiness in the nineties, had become a symbol of everything pretentious and unnatural about nineties cuisine. In Chang\xe2\x80\x99s mind, he was making fun of foam, but of course some people were not going to get that and were going to think he was just another leftover foam slave. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gonna piss people off,\xe2\x80\x9d he said happily. Serpico noticed a giant eggshell next to Chang\xe2\x80\x99s computer. \xe2\x80\x9cIs that the ostrich egg you cooked up the other day?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cHow was it?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIt was awful,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted it over easy, you know\xe2\x80\x94I wanted to pretend I was Fred Flintstone. So I got a big rondeau, put like two inches of oil, and I was gonna deep-fry the motherfucker, but there was so much water content in the white that it just sort of dispersed. It looked like cottage cheese.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cEww.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe egg yolk, though\xe2\x80\x94the egg yolk was massive. Equivalent to twenty-four chicken eggs.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWow.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be ready to roll next week,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf not, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna chop Hiro\xe2\x80\x99s pinkie off.\xe2\x80\x9d Hiro was Ko\xe2\x80\x99s architect.\t \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t wait,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fucking killing myself, man. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to do. I guess I could look for an apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico had to be out of his apartment in less than a month but had not yet found another place to live. He has not historically paid much attention to his living arrangements. He is twenty-six and inherited his first bed a year ago. Until then, he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t even owned a mattress\xe2\x80\x94he just slept on the floor. He still doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a closet: he drops his clothes at the laundry, then just takes stuff as he needs it right out of the bag. He has cooked at home once in six years. If he isn\xe2\x80\x99t eating at the restaurant, he usually gets McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s or KFC.  Serpico\xe2\x80\x99s habits are not unusual among the cooks at Momofuku. Chang never cooks at home, either\xe2\x80\x94he orders Chinese or pizza. He had a bed in his old apartment, but only because it had been left behind by the previous tenant. Recently, he bought a place, but he had no furniture, so one day he braced himself and went to Crate &amp; Barrel. He had only an hour to shop, though, so he picked out one of the mockup rooms and told a salesperson he wanted to buy everything in it, just as it was. The consequence of this, he realized when the furniture arrived, was that his apartment looked like a hotel room, but at least there was stuff on the floor.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re freaking out,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s go cook, dude.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is awesome!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang cried to Serpico, running his hands along the countertop. For the first time, Ko was starting to look like a restaurant. It was filthy, it was tiny, it was constructed almost entirely of plywood\xe2\x80\x94walls, doors, counter, cabinets\xe2\x80\x94but it was a restaurant, and soon they would cook there. \xe2\x80\x9cTelepan saw this last night,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. Bill Telepan runs the restaurant Telepan, on the Upper West Side. \xe2\x80\x9cHe laughed his ass off. He\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98This is the smallest fucking place I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever gotten into.\xe2\x80\x99 You\xe2\x80\x99re a dumb man, Serpico. Nobody in their right mind would do something like this.\xe2\x80\x9d Chang was hoping that the opening of Ko would be marginally less disastrous than the opening of his first two restaurants, but he was expecting the worst. Already they\xe2\x80\x99d saved themselves from several ideas that, in retrospect, seemed to them so incredibly stupid it was hard to believe they\xe2\x80\x99d had them in the first place. The idea that the cooks would wash all the dishes themselves during service, for instance. That had been a kind of principled thing for Chang\xe2\x80\x94he felt that no one who worked for Momofuku should be too proud to help out with the grossest tasks in the kitchen\xe2\x80\x94but it was still a really bad idea. They were sticking to the concept that there would be no servers, because Chang wanted the cooks to get all the tips. (\xe2\x80\x9cServers are such greedy bastards,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. A server at Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar could bring in seventeen hundred dollars in a week working thirty-two hours; a cook working the same hours would earn three hundred and fifty.) On the other hand, most cooks were not fully domesticated, and it was already expecting kind of a lot to have them do their job two feet from normal people who were paying to have a pleasant evening. (Ko is set up like a sushi bar, with all the customers at a counter facing the stoves.) Asking them to act like waiters as well might be one step too far.  It was unbelievable how many decisions had to be made before they opened. Just figuring out how to pour the miso soup into bowls in front of the customer had taken a whole discussion with Cory Lane. (Cory Lane manages the front of the house\xe2\x80\x94servers, setup, beverages\xe2\x80\x94at all three restaurants. He went to cooking school, decided that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very good cook, and became a wine expert instead.) \xe2\x80\x9cWhat would be easier is maybe a small pot, like something ghetto, and then just pour it in,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang had said.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo, you\xe2\x80\x99re leaning over and you pour it from the pan,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \t \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s gonna get all over the place!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou wanna spoon it or ladle it. Like a teapot, dude.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWith those sake carafes, you can do them ahead of time and they hold hot for a little while,\xe2\x80\x9d Lane suggested.  \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, man. You reach over and you pour it right in their bowl,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said, pouring the liquid from a tiny saucepan into a bowl over the back of a spoon, so that it flowed smoothly and didn\xe2\x80\x99t splash.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat I like, pouring it over the back of the spoon like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Lane said approvingly. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, you can go anywhere and have a soup poured tableside out of a fucking pitcher. I like that.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the beginning, Chang\xe2\x80\x99s whole goal was to open a noodle bar. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t really give much thought to what he would do with it once he did. When he thinks back on the ridiculous way he went about starting his first restaurant, four years ago, and the way it succeeded so wildly, despite his complete ignorance of the business and all the mistakes he made as a consequence, and led to another restaurant, and then another, and all the chef\xe2\x80\x99s prizes he\xe2\x80\x99s received since, it all seems to him like an impossible fairy tale, and he becomes convinced that it could vanish at any moment. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I didn\xe2\x80\x99t deserve any of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI blame my parents for my guilty conscience. Growing up, no one ever told me, \xe2\x80\x98Dave, you\xe2\x80\x99re smart, you\xe2\x80\x99re fast, you\xe2\x80\x99re witty\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94it was quite the opposite. I\xe2\x80\x99m still so insecure, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m Forrest Gump\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99m mildly retarded, and people are, like, \xe2\x80\x98Look how far this guy has come!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Chang\xe2\x80\x99s parents emigrated from Korea as adults in the nineteen-sixties, he from North Korea, she from South. His father, Joe, had fifty dollars when he arrived. He started out working as a dishwasher in New York, and later moved to a suburb of Washington, D.C., and opened a couple of delis. He began making real money when David was a teen-ager (David is the youngest of four), with a golf-supplies business. David became a junior golf champion but quit when he was thirteen.  Chang was miserable in school and claims to have failed everything. \xe2\x80\x9cI never even made the high-school golf team,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI was too much of a head case. Remember that scene in \xe2\x80\x98The Royal Tenenbaums\xe2\x80\x99 when Luke Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s playing tennis and crying and he throws his shoe? That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was like.\xe2\x80\x9d He went to Trinity College, in Connecticut, but says he only got in because he was Asian; he smoked pot almost every day. But one thing that interested him was religion\xe2\x80\x94his parents and his sister were very involved with a Korean Presbyterian church, and he had turned against that\xe2\x80\x94so he became a religion major and wrote a thesis on Thoreau. Something about the mindful ordinariness of \xe2\x80\x9cWalden\xe2\x80\x9d appealed to him\xe2\x80\x94the elevation of daily repetitions into an honorable way of life. \xe2\x80\x9cEven menial tasks such as domestic chores were a pleasant pastime,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cHe enjoyed these duties because he completed them with painstaking diligence.\xe2\x80\x9d After college, he spent six months at the French Culinary Institute; at the same time, he worked the dinner shift at Mercer Kitchen and, on his days off, answered phones at Craft until he got a job as a cook. Meanwhile, for years he\xe2\x80\x99d been obsessed with ramen (\xe2\x80\x9cmomofuku\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9clucky peach,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is also the name of the man who invented packaged ramen noodles), and he knew he wanted to apprentice in a Japanese noodle shop. Finally, an opportunity presented itself: his aunt was friends with Reverend Paul Hwang, a Korean businessman who had turned a building he owned in Tokyo into a combination church and men\xe2\x80\x99s homeless shelter, with a ramen shop on the first floor. Reverend Hwang said that Chang could live in the homeless shelter and work in the ramen shop. As it turned out, Reverend Hwang\xe2\x80\x99s ramen shop was one of the few really bad ramen shops in Tokyo, so Chang didn\xe2\x80\x99t stay there for long, but his true apprenticeship came from eating around the city and realizing what it meant to live in a food culture where even the smallest, cheapest place served food more delicious than you could get in half the restaurants in Manhattan.  \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be Client 9\xe2\x80\x94we\xe2\x80\x99re retiring that number.\xe2\x80\x9d Share Tweet  Buy a cartoon  When he got back to New York, he got a job at Caf\xc3\xa9 Boulud, a three-star restaurant on the Upper East Side then being run by Andrew Carmellini. He worked six or seven days a week, fifteen-hour days (though only because he felt he had to get there two hours early to keep up). It was brutal. \xe2\x80\x9cCaf\xc3\xa9 Boulud was intentionally difficult,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was chip-on-your-shoulder cooking, like, all these other restaurants have twice as many cooks, all this new equipment, and we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna fucking outcook them with nothing but our sheer will and technique.\xe2\x80\x9d But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just machismo\xe2\x80\x94it was also beautiful. \xe2\x80\x9cAndrew knows how things should taste,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s crystal clear in his mind. There were so many instances when he was, like, \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s missing something, do this,\xe2\x80\x99 and it\xe2\x80\x99s fucking perfect.\xe2\x80\x9d Chang felt lucky to be working in such a kitchen, but he was preoccupied with trouble at home\xe2\x80\x94fights between his father and his oldest brother over the family business, then his mother being diagnosed with cancer\xe2\x80\x94and he could feel that he was starting to freak out. His hands were shaking so much that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sauce plates. Finally, he had an epiphany. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t I cook something simple?\xe2\x80\x9d he said to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not an awesome cook\xe2\x80\x94I just want to make noodles.\xe2\x80\x9d He quit Caf\xc3\xa9 Boulud and moved home for a while to help take care of his mother. Then he put together a business plan, asked his father for just shy of two hundred thousand dollars in seed money, and started looking for a place to open a noodle bar. He signed a lease on a six-hundred-square-foot storefront at First Avenue and Tenth Street in early 2004. He asked some of his friends to come in on it with him, but nobody wanted to leave a job for a venture that was certain to fail. Fine, he thought, I\xe2\x80\x99ll do it all myself. But just before the restaurant was due to open he found another cook, a guy named Joaquin Baca, who responded to an ad he\xe2\x80\x99d placed on monster.com. Baca had worked in restaurants in Santa Fe but since moving to New York had been offered only insultingly bad entry-level jobs. He figured he had nothing to lose, and signed up.  At first, it was just Chang and Baca, seven days a week. The menu was very simple: ramen noodles with shredded pork, seven dollars; Momofuku ramen with pork and a poached egg, twelve dollars; steamed rice noodles; pork buns; cash only. Chang was living in a horrible little apartment across the street. He would arrive at the restaurant at seven, prep all the food, take deliveries, and cook the lunch service by himself. He left around four, took a two-hour nap, then came back to help Baca with dinner. They had practically no customers. The Japanese place across the street, which was terrible in his opinion, was always packed. They started hiring people\xe2\x80\x94dishwashers, cooks, servers\xe2\x80\x94but nobody could meet Chang\xe2\x80\x99s standards, so he fired them all. Those he didn\xe2\x80\x99t fire quit. Finally, Chang and Baca decided that if they were going to go broke they might as well do it in style, and they started cooking what they felt like\xe2\x80\x94stranger, more adventurous dishes with better ingredients. And then it all began to happen. Just as Ko was finally coming together, at the end of February, Chang stopped by Noodle Bar one day and saw so much sloppiness in the kitchen that he flew into one of his rages. Most chefs yell, but Chang is on a different level. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one gets angry like I get angry,\xe2\x80\x9d he says unhappily. \xe2\x80\x9cI just turn into a complete maniac. My brain feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna explode. It takes me a day to recover\xe2\x80\x94I have to lie down and put ice on my head.\xe2\x80\x9d  At Noodle Bar, a junior line cook had been cooking chicken for family meal\xe2\x80\x94lunch for the staff\xe2\x80\x94and although he had to cook something like seventy-five chicken pieces and the stoves were mostly empty, he\xe2\x80\x99d been cooking them in only two pans, which meant that he was wasting time he could have spent helping to prep for dinner. Also, he was cooking with tongs, which was bad technique, it ripped the food apart, it was how you cooked at T.G.I. Friday\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94he should have been using a spoon or a spatula. Cooking with tongs showed disrespect for the chicken, disrespect for family meal, and, by extension, disrespect for the entire restaurant. But the guy cooking family meal was just the beginning of it. Walking down the line, Chang had spotted another cook cutting fish cake into slices that were totally uneven and looked like hell. Someone else was handling ice-cream cones with her bare hands, touching the end that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t covered in paper. None of these mistakes was egregious in itself, but all of them together made Chang feel that Noodle Bar\xe2\x80\x99s kitchen was degenerating into decadence and anarchy. He had screamed and yelled until a friend showed up and dragged him out of the restaurant, and his head still hurt nearly twenty-four hours later.  The following afternoon, Chang called an emergency meeting for the staff. Something was rotten in Noodle Bar, and he meant to cut it out and destroy it before it was too late.  \xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t been spending that much time in this restaurant because of all the shit that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on,\xe2\x80\x9d he began, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the past two days I\xe2\x80\x99ve had aneurisms because I\xe2\x80\x99ve been so upset at the kitchen. On the cooks\xe2\x80\x99 end, I question your integrity. Are you willing to fucking sacrifice yourself for the food? Yesterday, we had an incident with fish cakes: they weren\xe2\x80\x99t properly cut. Does it really matter in the bowl of ramen? No. But for personal integrity as a cook, this is what we do, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think you guys fucking care enough. It takes those little things, the properly cut scallions, to set us apart from Uno\xe2\x80\x99s and McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t step up our game, we\xe2\x80\x99re headed toward the middle, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fucking work there.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not the best cooks, we\xe2\x80\x99re not the best restaurant\xe2\x80\x94if you were a really good cook you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be working here, because really good cooks are assholes. But we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna try our best, and that\xe2\x80\x99s as a team. Recently, over at Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar, a sous-chef closed improperly, there were a lot of mistakes, and I was livid and I let this guy have it. About a week later, I found out that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t him, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even at the restaurant that night. But what he said was \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry, it will never happen again.\xe2\x80\x99 And you know what? I felt like an asshole for yelling at him, but, more important, I felt like, Wow, this is what we want to build our company around: guys that have this level of integrity. Just because we\xe2\x80\x99re not Per Se, just because we\xe2\x80\x99re not Daniel, just because we\xe2\x80\x99re not a four-star restaurant, why can\xe2\x80\x99t we have the same fucking standards? If we start being accountable not only for our own actions but for everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s actions, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna do some awesome shit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although Chang decided early on that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be doing fine dining in his own career, its titans are still the inspiration for everything he does. A few weeks ago, he took his girlfriend for her birthday to Per Se, a restaurant in Columbus Circle founded by Thomas Keller and now run by Jonathan Benno, who was a sous-chef at Craft when Chang worked there. The meal at Per Se took six hours, and it was flawless. Chang was so overcome by the dazzling perfection of the food, and so drunk from all the paired wines, that he cried.  Chang reveres chefs like Benno and Keller and Wylie Dufresne for bringing adventurous cooking to America, but his idol is the Spanish chef Ferran Adri\xc3\xa0. Adri\xc3\xa0 calls his food \xe2\x80\x9cdeconstructivist\xe2\x80\x9d; few of his dishes are what they appear to be. He was the originator of the foam craze, but that was a long time ago. He continues to contrive ever more rococo and outlandish preparations in his laboratory in Barcelona: slivers of sea urchin enclosed in a transparent raviolo of kombu seaweed, which look like goldfish swimming in water; balls of pur\xc3\xa9ed hazelnut, formed by dropping the pur\xc3\xa9e from a syringe into liquid nitrogen; a two-metre-long spaghetto made of liquid Parmesan jelled in a PVC tube. In Chang\xe2\x80\x99s view, two hundred years from now Adri\xc3\xa0 is the only chef, besides Escoffier, whom people will still be studying and talking about. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s trying to rethink food,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was the first guy to say, \xe2\x80\x98Food can be poetic, it can be abstract.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Adri\xc3\xa0\xe2\x80\x99s aberrant fantasies are not, to be sure, daily reference points for Chang\xe2\x80\x99s cooking, but the idea of Noodle Bar from the start was to take the humblest meal\xe2\x80\x94a bowl of noodles, a pork bun\xe2\x80\x94and, with a combination of obsessive devotion and four-star technique, turn it into something amazing. Take the chicken wings, for instance. All you knew when you were eating them was that they tasted really good. What you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know was that they\xe2\x80\x99d been brined in a salt-and-sugar solution for a whole day (but not longer, or they\xe2\x80\x99d be too salty), then dried out and cold-smoked over mesquite for forty-five minutes, then poached in a vat of pork fat for an hour and a half, then browned on the flat-top, then glazed in a chicken-infused soy sauce combined with mirin, garlic, and pickled chili peppers. Each step, executed perfectly, was vital to the dish. This was what the cooks at Noodle Bar had to understand.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou guys have to ask yourself as cooks, how bad do you want this?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang declared at the meeting, warming up to his finale. \xe2\x80\x9cLife and death is what it means to me. And next time I see something that is not up to my standards I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna let you fucking go. What we want are people with high character that are gonna look each other in the eye and be like, I gave you my best effort today. We want the person who fucked up not to be able to sleep at night because he\xe2\x80\x99s so embarrassed, and the next day to be like, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get better, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna get better.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn four years, we\xe2\x80\x99ve gone from that small-ass Noodle Bar to this fucking big restaurant, when the whole goal in the beginning was, let\xe2\x80\x99s serve better food than that place across the street. I know we\xe2\x80\x99ve won awards, all this stuff, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not because we\xe2\x80\x99re doing something special\xe2\x80\x94I believe it\xe2\x80\x99s really because we care more than the next guy. So the next time you\xe2\x80\x99re at your station and you see someone going down in flames\xe2\x80\x94and every night someone goes down in flames\xe2\x80\x94you gotta ask yourself, Do I have this person\xe2\x80\x99s back? Because when the kitchen\xe2\x80\x99s really humming, you know what? Getting into the weeds is a lot of fucking fun.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThis is looking sharp, chef!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said, running his hands over Ko\xe2\x80\x99s newly shiny ovens. Serpico had been scrubbing for hours.  \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I tried to clean the shit out of the floor yesterday but it\xe2\x80\x99s still, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said.  \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s put this table back in.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I want to clean the floor one more time. I\xe2\x80\x99m weird about some shit, all right? The floor\xe2\x80\x99s fucking disgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d The floor looked pretty clean, but not clean enough for Serpico. Every cook had something he was weird about. For Chang, it was badly folded towels. For Sam Gelman, it was spoons and aprons. (Gelman, Ko\xe2\x80\x99s sous-chef, was twenty-six. He was from Iowa and liked to fish.)  They were making progress. The wine fridge had arrived. The glasses had been taken care of\xe2\x80\x94Ravenscroft had donated them. Christina Tosi, the dessert cook, had come up with an awe-inspiring dish: panna cotta made from cornflakes milk, served on a smear of avocado. A middle-aged man in a black leather jacket came in. It was Pedro, the rep from Cascade Linen Supply. \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., so you guys have nice napkins, serviettes?\xe2\x80\x9d Pedro asked. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you bring me a sample?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhite. Do you have nicer chef coats?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe ones that you have are the standard,\xe2\x80\x9d Pedro said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want something nice, it\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be more expensive. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if you want to go into Bragard chef coats.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not the real Bragards,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang told him. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re made in China. They suck.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have the bib aprons that are longer?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico asked. \xe2\x80\x9cI noticed that all your bib aprons now come down to the knee.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cOne blue apron for chef,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not wearing a blue apron, dude.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think there\xe2\x80\x99s an upper class in Heaven?\xe2\x80\x9d Share Tweet  Buy a cartoon  One of the few things that make Chang happy in life is setting up his friends in restaurants of their own, and the fact that Serpico was going to be in charge of Ko made him feel very good. But there were always more friends, and the thought of opening up new restaurants was always alluring. He\xe2\x80\x99s been talking to some people about opening a huge Momofuku in Las Vegas, with a several-thousand-square-foot kitchen and top-of-the-line equipment. His mind boggles thinking about what he could do with that kind of kitchen\xe2\x80\x94no more worrying about whether a dish could be cooked quickly on a tiny plancha with three guys bumping into one another. Some other people recently offered to help him start a place in Dubai, and he flew out to take a look. He was dazzled\xe2\x80\x94the speed of it, the wild energy, the gigantic buildings going up every day, the indoor ski slope, and everyone seemed to be happy there, even migrant workers seemed to him to have a pretty good deal. He came back feeling as if he\xe2\x80\x99d visited the future and America had no more juice. To be part of something like that\xe2\x80\x94how could he resist? He knows he wants to open more restaurants, but the question is what kind. The obvious thing would be to open a temple of fine dining that would declare his ascension into the chef firmament, preferably an eponymous temple that would secure his immortality in the public mind, but the idea made him sick. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would you name a restaurant after yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine opening a restaurant called David Chang\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94I\xe2\x80\x99d fucking off myself. I just want to make sure that I don\xe2\x80\x99t become a total asshole.\xe2\x80\x9d Expansion, like most things in life, seemed to him to offer choices any of which would make him feel that he\xe2\x80\x99d screwed things up forever and lost whatever scrap of honor he once possessed. If he did expand, he\xe2\x80\x99d feel like a whore and an egomaniac, selling his chefly virtue for cash; if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t expand, he\xe2\x80\x99d feel like a pretentious artiste throwing away an opportunity that could help his friends because he was so in love with his precious integrity. He\xe2\x80\x99d always liked the idea of starting a fast-food chain\xe2\x80\x94he and Tosi have talked about opening a Momofuku Milk Bar, with soft-serve ice cream, like Dairy Queen. The great thing about fast food was that you could sell out without worrying about it, because fast food was unpretentious and selling out was the nature of the business. Or something like that. It was always possible, of course, that he would drop dead before he had a chance to do any of this. Some time ago, his doctor told him he had high blood pressure and had to take a vacation, so he went to Costa Rica by himself and sat on the beach and read and felt better. But then last summer was very stressful, what with trying to get Noodle Bar open in a new location, and one day he came into work feeling as if he were dying, and his left cheek went numb. He went to the emergency room, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out what was wrong. A couple of days later, he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of bed because of a terrible pain in his back, so he went to a chiropractor, but the chiropractor didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was wrong, either. The next day, he lost his hearing in his left ear and had a terrible pain in his jaw. Then his face became covered in spots that hurt, so he went to a dermatologist, who told him that he had shingles, and that it meant he was dangerously tense. He told him to take a vacation immediately, somewhere cold and dark where his face could heal, so Chang went to Montreal. He sat in his hotel and went to dinner by himself every night. It was awful. When he got back, he realized that he needed to make some changes in his life, which was why, these days, he was trying to stay out of the kitchen. The trouble was, although not being in the kitchen removed one cause of stress, it replaced it with another. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not cooking every day anymore, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the biggest withdrawal,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cCooking is honest work. Now I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to measure myself.\xe2\x80\x9d  He never set out to become a famous person. He just wanted to see if he could open a noodle bar. Now he finds that he\xe2\x80\x99s a public figure, criticized and praised\xe2\x80\x94but mostly praised\xe2\x80\x94by people he\xe2\x80\x99s never met. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting these awards freaks me out\xe2\x80\x94the last thing I want is a Michelin star\xe2\x80\x94because I know I\xe2\x80\x99m not the best,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. When he thinks about the cooks he worked with at Craft and Caf\xc3\xa9 Boulud and how they were so much more skilled than he, and had put in more years than he had, and yet here he was getting all these prizes and all this attention, he feels himself starting to panic. Sometimes he tries to comfort himself thinking about all the bands he loves that made great music even though they were terrible musicians, but somehow it\xe2\x80\x99s not the same. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m losing my ability to understand reality,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9clike when someone loses their hearing, they can still speak English, but their speech eventually becomes distorted because they can\xe2\x80\x99t hear themselves. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be this crazy. It\xe2\x80\x99s tiring. I just want some mental clarity. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t like that I\xe2\x80\x99m becoming more self-aware of all my problems. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make me feel better\xe2\x80\x94I just feel unease almost all the time. I\xe2\x80\x99m a total head case right now, I cannot keep this up. All I want to do is fucking move to Idaho and ski and fish and read books. All I want to do is run away and stop.\xe2\x80\x9d  There are several mother figures in his life who worry about his health and try to persuade him to run away and stop: Ruth Reichl, the editor of Gourmet; Dana Cowin, the editor of Food &amp; Wine; Alice Waters, the founder of Chez Panisse. \xe2\x80\x9cI never thought that I\xe2\x80\x99d be able to be, like, friends with Alice Waters,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd for her to actually care about me\xe2\x80\x94that is so weird. I think Ruth told her that I had shingles, and that\xe2\x80\x99s when Alice had an intervention at lunch. She was like, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything more, no more, no more!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Then, there are the older-brother chef figures who know he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to stop but who tell him to calm down. Andrew Carmellini bought him yoga lessons. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was just when Momofuku started to really roll,\xe2\x80\x9d Carmellini says, \xe2\x80\x9cand I was, like, \xe2\x80\x98Dude, I\xe2\x80\x99m telling you from personal experience, you need to chill out.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mario Batali, who has opened seven restaurants in New York, three in Las Vegas, and two in L.A., while hosting two programs on the Food Network and appearing regularly on \xe2\x80\x9cIron Chef,\xe2\x80\x9d comes into Noodle Bar a fair amount and gives Chang counsel. \xe2\x80\x9cMario\xe2\x80\x99s big thing to me is \xe2\x80\x98Dave, would you fucking be happy?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Chang says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loves it. He loves life. I want to love life as much as Mario loves life.\xe2\x80\x9d He sighs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that I\xe2\x80\x99m not happy; I\xe2\x80\x99m just fearful for the future,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m fearful that everything\xe2\x80\x99s gonna be taken away. Fear is a driving force for most of the things that I do. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that\xe2\x80\x99s healthy.\xe2\x80\x9d Sometimes he imagines a way out that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be just skiing and reading. He could start up some kind of project in New York like Alice Waters\xe2\x80\x99s Edible Schoolyard, where kids learn to grow their own crops and work in a garden. Growing vegetables, keeping animals, teaching people about food\xe2\x80\x94he would love that. Recently, he picked out a piglet at a small farm in Jeffersonville, New York\xe2\x80\x94the runt of the litter, to go with the Momofuku underdog mentality\xe2\x80\x94named it Squint, and made arrangements with the farmer to slaughter it himself when it got big enough. He wanted to see if he could kill an animal that he had come to know, that was as smart as a dog, in order to understand better where the hundreds of pounds of pork that he cooked every week were coming from. But then he thinks about all the people working for him, and relying on him, and how they could get rich if he gets rich and then could do whatever they wanted, and the farm thing seems kind of small.  \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so sick and tired of how awesome it is to work at Google or fucking Apple or one of those tech companies,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy can\xe2\x80\x99t it be awesome to work for a food company? Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we create an environment where people are trying to push each other to do great things, and we\xe2\x80\x99re not trying to steal from anybody, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be good to our farmers and run an honorable business, if there is such a thing anymore? I feel that it would be cowardly and selfish to say, You know what, screw this.\xe2\x80\x9d He is trying to make Momofuku a good place to work: he is sharing ownership with his chefs, and he is buying good health-care plans for his permanent staff and sponsoring English lessons for the prep cooks. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was solely about money, I could have sold out a long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t feel good about it, because I\xe2\x80\x99d let everyone down. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. I\xe2\x80\x99m slowly realizing that I\xe2\x80\x99m a highly complex individual.\xe2\x80\x9d  Even assuming that he can take on more restaurants and not end up in five years dead or in a straitjacket, there are downsides to expansion. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m finally dating somebody that I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate her guts,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had dinner yesterday and I was like, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you at all! You know?\xe2\x80\x9d His girlfriend is also Korean-American, and was also raised to be brilliant at something\xe2\x80\x94where he played golf, she played the violin. She now works in the advertising department of Microsoft. She seems to tolerate him amazingly well. \xe2\x80\x9cI am the worst boyfriend ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m high maintenance. I mean, you have no idea how high maintenance.\xe2\x80\x9d All of this, combined with the fact that he knows his parents want nothing more than for him to marry a girl of pure Korean blood and provide them with grandchildren (none of his siblings seem likely to oblige), has made him think differently about the future. In Europe, he knows, there are great chefs who open just one restaurant and are happy with that. They have families, they take vacations, they see their friends. On a recent trip to France for a food conference, he and Tosi had an epic meal in Paris at Pascal Barbot\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant, L\xe2\x80\x99Astrance. The kitchen was tiny, and the restaurant had only twenty-five seats. It was open Tuesday through Saturday. It closed in August. And it had three Michelin stars. That was integrity, Chang felt; that was dignity. But in America, somehow, a career like Barbot\xe2\x80\x99s just didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem possible.  After all the waiting, the delays, the mess, the cleaning, the decisions, the ordering, the planning, and the cooking, opening day had come. Ko was scrubbed, Ko was stocked, Ko was ready. It would open officially that evening at five-thirty, and at six o\xe2\x80\x99clock its first two customers would walk through the door, sit down at the counter, and be fed dinner. Of course, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be real customers tonight\xe2\x80\x94just cooks from the other restaurants, plus a couple of girlfriends. Chang was nervous, and not just because he was always nervous: something weird was going on. In the past week, four inspectors had shown up at Ko\xe2\x80\x94State Liquor, Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Comp., the Fire Department, and the Buildings Department. That was more inspectors than had shown up at either of the other restaurants in a year. It couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a coincidence. Was somebody out to get them?  Chang grabbed some plates and bowls and started lining them up along the counter in order to figure out what the various courses should be served in. Anxiety was making him manic. He couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sit still.  \xe2\x80\x9cEgg dish in here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, putting down a bowl. \xe2\x80\x9cShort rib here.\xe2\x80\x9d He stared at the eight bowls and plates in front of him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fucking courses, man. Super V.I.P.\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico moved around the kitchen slowly and deliberately. He was keeping very calm. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m so scared,\xe2\x80\x9d he sang under his breath. Cory Lane squatted down at the expediting station to stock the chef\xe2\x80\x99s mini-fridge with Budweiser and Coke, then leaped up to grab a pile of napkins.  \xe2\x80\x9cEugene!\xe2\x80\x9d he called to one of the new cooks. \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is not Eugene,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said sharply. \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is James Mark.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cChang said his name was Eugene,\xe2\x80\x9d Lane said.  \xe2\x80\x9cDave comes up with the worst nicknames for people, have you noticed that?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. He paced up and down behind the counter, checking his mise en place, muttering to himself.  \xe2\x80\x9cLychees, I have. Nori. Rice sticks.\xe2\x80\x9d He looked down at a checklist he had written out. \xe2\x80\x9cButtermilk. Eggs. Caviar. Scallops. Kimchi.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cDid you remember to scatter a few spear points and arrowheads back there for future generations to ponder?\xe2\x80\x9d Share Tweet  Buy a cartoon  Chang seized a towel and started maniacally wiping down the counter. James Mark was scrubbing the flat-top and the plancha while Serpico sprayed and polished the front surfaces of the ovens. A man showed up at the door, asking for a job as a dishwasher. Chang picked up his BlackBerry and checked his messages.  \xe2\x80\x9cCall Tien Ho,\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled to Cory Lane. Tien Ho is the chef at Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him if he has a spare bo ss\xc3\xa4m.\xe2\x80\x9d Bo ss\xc3\xa4m is Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar\xe2\x80\x99s most famous dish\xe2\x80\x94a whole pork butt, plus kimchi and a dozen oysters, designed to be eaten wrapped in Bibb lettuce. It serves eight or nine, costs two hundred dollars, and usually requires ordering several days in advance.  \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants it?\xe2\x80\x9d Lane asked. \xe2\x80\x9cJamie Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s coming in to Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe naked chef?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThat guy.\xe2\x80\x9d At quarter to five, Serpico began filling up his mise en place with garnishes. He told James Mark to go to Noodle Bar and bring back one quart of turnips, one quart of carrots, and one quart of celery. Chang sat at the counter, thinking about all the things that were going to go wrong.  \xe2\x80\x9cDude, did you add water to that consomm\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Serpico. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was fucking strong.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cI got it, I got it.\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico was going down his checklist again. Chang stewed for a moment.  \xe2\x80\x9cHey, you wanna add squid ink to the nori powder to make it blacker? It looks like dirt.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know. Maybe.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDo we have mustard seeds?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d Chang looked at his watch. \xe2\x80\x9cThirty minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico leaned back against the stove and closed his eyes, his forearm against his forehead, for one second, and then snapped to attention again. Chang went to inspect the bathroom and discovered that the toilet-paper spindle was loose. Cory Lane began setting up for service: a cork at each place to rest chopsticks on, then a folded napkin, then a menu tucked inside the napkin, then a water glass. He measured to make sure that each napkin was exactly one thumb-length from the edge of the counter. Then he crouched down at the end of the row and squinted to check that everything was lined up.  \xe2\x80\x9cFive-thirty!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang called. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re open!\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cGelman, you got the short-rib sauce?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico asked his sous-chef. \xe2\x80\x9cWorking, chef,\xe2\x80\x9d Gelman said.  Chang sat down at the counter and started proofreading the menu. \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Ko\xe2\x80\x99 is overlapping the peach, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Gelman, who had laid out the menu on his computer. The orange peach was the symbol of the Momofuku brand. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there\xe2\x80\x99s a double space before \xe2\x80\x98Riesling.\xe2\x80\x99 Hey, are we clarifying the smoked solution?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Serpico, who was still fiddling with his garnishes. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s turning the eggs brown.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted the soft-cooked hen egg\xe2\x80\x94served with caviar, fines herbes, soubise, and homemade miniature potato chips\xe2\x80\x94to taste smoky, but the smoked solution was turning the outside of the egg the color of putty. It looked weird. Maybe even a little gross. White would be better. He leaned over the counter to inspect Serpico\xe2\x80\x99s mise en place. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you have the fish over here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.  \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to turn my back on customers while I\xe2\x80\x99m working,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of shady.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99re a shady guy, dude.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI gotta take a piss. I may not be back.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gelman was suddenly overcome with the significance of the moment. He whooped and grabbed Chang in a big hug.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the dream, dude!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dream kitchen!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, dude!\xe2\x80\x9d Gelman yelled, still hugging. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, can we open a bottle of champagne?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang called to Cory Lane. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a celebration!\xe2\x80\x9d But just then the first customer\xe2\x80\x94Justin, a cook at Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar\xe2\x80\x94walked in the door.  \xe2\x80\x9cHey!\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said to Gelman and Chang. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a customer in the house.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cJustin, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to start you off with a pork skin.\xe2\x80\x9d Chang placed it before him, perched on a slate slab, and watched intently as he picked it up. The deep-fried skin looked like a chrysalis, its surface all shiny little bubbles, curved around itself. Justin\xe2\x80\x99s teeth closed on the bubbles and broke them.  \xe2\x80\x9cCrunch!\xe2\x80\x9d Chang exulted. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s awesome!\xe2\x80\x9d Tex, another cook from Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar, arrived, and sat down in the next seat. Serpico bent low over two dishes of raw madai, the first course on the tasting menu, carefully sprinkling them with poppy seeds and chives. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what\xe2\x80\x99ll suck, Pete?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf someone doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like a dish.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYeah.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cCan I take these for you?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico asked as he removed the plates. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it fucked up to take a plate and then dump it in a plastic bus tray?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico asked. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s fucked up is if you finish their food in front of them.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cJames, you got my consomm\xc3\xa9 for two?\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico called.  \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Pete, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fucking good-looking dish,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang commented. \xe2\x80\x9cSoubise getting hot? Scallops getting ready? You got the dashi?\xe2\x80\x9d He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why I can\xe2\x80\x99t work here, dude. I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna drive everyone insane.\xe2\x80\x9d Tex finished his third course, the hen egg with caviar. There was nothing left on the plate.  \xe2\x80\x9cYou see, that makes me wonder, Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t you finish the consomm\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang asked him. Kimchi-infused consomm\xc3\xa9, poured over an oyster, a slice of pork belly, and a cabbage leaf, had been the second course. Tex smiled weakly.  \xe2\x80\x9cI just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to eat it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  Serpico and Chang were already preparing course number four, the scallop dish with the foaming dashi.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe need more color on this plate, dude,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need those chanterelles.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cI think it looks fucking sexy,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, julienne of red pepper?\xe2\x80\x9d It was a chef joke. Justin and Tex ate the scallop dish. \xe2\x80\x9cHow was it, guys?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang asked. Tex paused. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to really like nori,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it?\xe2\x80\x9d Tex paused. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, with all of you guys, if you think something sucks, you\xe2\x80\x99d better fucking say so,\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think it sucked?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNo!\xe2\x80\x9d Tex protested. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just . . .\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGet out,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. And then smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cSo here we have some gel\xc3\xa9e of Riesling, some pine-nut brittle, and some shaved foie gras.\xe2\x80\x9d  This foie dish was something else that Chang and Serpico had been experimenting with for a while. Chang had remembered that when Liz Chapman was the sous-chef at Casa Mono she used to freeze piment\xc3\xb3n butter and shave it onto summer corn. He figured he should be able to make foie flakes in the same way, since foie gras had the texture of butter\xe2\x80\x94he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether anyone else had done it already, so he called around. He discovered that some cook had played with it in the kitchen of Caf\xc3\xa9 Boulud, but no one seemed to have actually put it on a menu, so he figured he could claim to be first. (Originality was always a concern: Chang had spent weeks pur\xc3\xa9eing tofu and mixing it with meat glue, as he\xe2\x80\x99d seen Wylie Dufresne do in the kitchen of WD-50. He then steamed it into a ball and inserted a raw quail egg in the middle, thinking that the faux egg would make a perfect amuse, but at the last minute he\xe2\x80\x99d seen a chef on a food blog doing the same egg thing with cauliflower pur\xc3\xa9e, so he\xe2\x80\x99d abandoned it.) He placed the foie on the counter and looked up at Tex and Justin. \xe2\x80\x9cYou guys are really uncomfortable, aren\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to yell at you?\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex giggled. He tried the foie gras. \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang asked. \xe2\x80\x9cSlammin\xe2\x80\x99, man!\xe2\x80\x9d Tex said enthusiastically. \xe2\x80\x9cSee, I knew it, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like the consomm\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d It was six-forty-five. Justin and Tex had been eating only for forty minutes but they\xe2\x80\x99d already finished six courses, if you included the pork-skin amuse-bouche. Any faster and it would be KFC. \xe2\x80\x9cShit,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make everything bigger, man.\xe2\x80\x9d He watched as Tex ate his short-rib course and laid his knife\xe2\x80\x94an exceptionally sharp Japanese steak knife that Serpico had been very psyched about when they bought it\xe2\x80\x94on the edge of his plate. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous, dude,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said nervously, eyeing the knife. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like it. I mean, he turns to the side, customer walks by, they\xe2\x80\x99re dead. I\xe2\x80\x99m just saying.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chang saw James Mark shaving foie gras inelegantly, and he leaped over to stop him. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t be back here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to Serpico. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gonna lose my shit.\xe2\x80\x9d He walked out of the chef\xe2\x80\x99s area, sat down at the counter next to Tex, and started to make a list of everything that had gone wrong so far. Suddenly Gelman spotted two customers about to eat the oysters and pork bellies in their bowls, not realizing that they were supposed to wait for Serpico to pour consomm\xc3\xa9 on top.\t \xe2\x80\x9cHey, hold it!\xe2\x80\x9d Gelman shouted at them. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t eat that yet!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou gonna yell at the customers, man?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang asked him.  \xe2\x80\x9cYeah!\xe2\x80\x9d Gelman said. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, don\xe2\x80\x99t eat that, asshole!\xe2\x80\x9d he barked.  \xe2\x80\x9cCan you imagine if we did \xc3\xa0 la carte?\xe2\x80\x9d Chang said. They had been going to offer \xc3\xa0 la carte until about two days ago. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fucking disaster.\xe2\x80\x9d Serpico was cleaning up his station when two last customers he\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten about, a cook from Ss\xc3\xa4m Bar and his girlfriend, walked in.  \xe2\x80\x9cOh fuck, man, two more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said loudly.  Chang couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cGreat greeting, dude,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a bad idea this restaurant is. We\xe2\x80\x99re gonna be serving steak and cheese in about five weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the last customers were on their way to finishing, Chang sent Cory Lane to Noodle Bar for some bourbon to lubricate the postmortem. Serpico squatted in a corner behind the counter.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since I went down that bad,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x9d Chang told him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we opened Noodle Bar, you got smoked so bad.
