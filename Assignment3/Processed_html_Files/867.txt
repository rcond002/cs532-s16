We\xc3\xa2\xe2\x82\xac\xe2\x84\xa2re excited to announce that Screencheat will be coming to Xbox One on March 1, 2016! In Screencheat, all players are invisible, forcing you to look at the other screens to find your opponents to hunt them. We were inspired to create it by all of the split screen games we played as kids, including Halo. We used to sit around and screencheat each other all the time so we decided to turn this controversial tactic on its head and make it the core mechanic of the game.
