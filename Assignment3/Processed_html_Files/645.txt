My guest could have said \xe2\x80\x9chipster Thanksgiving,\xe2\x80\x9d too (the room was bursting not with Chinese diners from the neighborhood but with bewhiskered gents from Bushwick sporting topknots and spiffy corduroy vests). \xe2\x80\x9cGonzo-chef Thanksgiving\xe2\x80\x9d was also a possibility (Pok Pok\xe2\x80\x99s Andy Ricker was in the crowd, along with numerous other tattooed kitchen luminaries), as was \xe2\x80\x9chigh-roller Thanksgiving\xe2\x80\x9d (a caviar service is offered, and a lavish $150 prime rib) or \xe2\x80\x9clarge-format Thanksgiving\xe2\x80\x9d (on our table were the remains of a whole fish, an entire duck, and a smoked pork jowl the size of a small rugby ball).\nIn Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s hands, this kind of happy chaos is not a bad thing, of course. The West Coast chef has his talents as a cook, but his real genius is for creating a grand sense of occasion, and at this larger, more sophisticated Mission outlet, you get the impression that he finally has a proper New York stage to call his own. Unlike the previous incarnation, a ramshackle venue on Orchard Street, this room, on the eastern fringes of Chinatown, has an air of permanence about it. The napkins are rose-pink linen, and there\xe2\x80\x99s a large round table fitted with a lazy Susan in the time-honored neighborhood style. Chandeliers hang from the ceiling, and comfortable, vermillion-colored banquettes line the walls. Instead of one tiny bar, there are now two lounge areas where you can sip strange cocktail creations (General Tso\xe2\x80\x99s Old Fashioned being among the strangest) while waiting for a table, instead of joining a riotous two-hour-long line on the sidewalk.\nThe most conspicuous difference between the old Mission Chinese and the new one, however, is that this time around, the lavishly eclectic, consistently inventive cooking is arguably worth a two-hour wait. I\xe2\x80\x99m one of the few churls who publicly objected to the gut-busting, one-note quality of Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s endlessly hyped neo-Sichuan nose-to-tail recipes at the Orchard Street restaurant. So imagine my surprise when the first dish we tasted was a complimentary serving of pan-fried dumplings stuffed not with a fatty mash of pork products but with a delicate mix of tapioca and scrambled eggs. This was followed by a bowl of warm, faintly sweet Japanese noodles sprinkled with matcha-green-tea powder, and an artful rendition of cold shredded chicken plated with a beautifully balanced Southeast Asian salad of green papaya and banana blossoms instead of the usual glistening slick of spicy sesame paste.\nThese new, gentler recipes are executed by Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s Filipino-American executive chef, Angela Dimayuga, who grew up in San Jose and has a knack for imbuing her cooking with that particular Filipino combination of lightness and good old-fashioned heft. Sichuan-peppercorn freaks can now complement the Bowien classics (thrice-cooked bacon, the lustrous heritage-pork mapo tofu) with delicate \xe2\x80\x9clettuce cups\xe2\x80\x9d filled with beef tartare, trays of sea urchin and market sashimi from the new \xe2\x80\x9cRaw Bar\xe2\x80\x9d section of the menu, and an excellent fresh-baked-bread service fired on the wood-burning oven left over from the joint that used to occupy the space. The chewy char siu pork cheeks are cured in healthful beet juice, and the crisped, tender house Hainanese-style fried chicken is air-dried with koji (fermented rice) and served with a lemony sauce to cut the richness.\nAt the old Mission Chinese, my instinct was to call for the check after a bite or two of stir-fried pork belly, then curl up under the table for a digestive nap. This menu, though, is full of surprises, and the more corners you explore, the more your appetite tends to increase. Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s ingenious salt-cod fried rice is still the rice dish to get, but poke around the \xe2\x80\x9cNoodle Corner\xe2\x80\x9d section, and you will find concoctions made with the aforementioned green tea and even steamed oats. The \xe2\x80\x9cChef\xe2\x80\x99s Specialties\xe2\x80\x9d section contains not one but two impressive head-on fish options (one \xe2\x80\x9cdrunken style,\xe2\x80\x9d the other whole fried on a tray with chunks of taro and turnip), which you can enjoy with five varieties of soup, including an updated version of that old Chinese classic winter melon, which the cooks flavor with black truffles and seal with an Instagram-friendly en cro\xc3\xbbte top.\nSome of Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s theatrical experiments in off-the-wall family-style fusion cooking work better than others, of course. That rugby-ball-size smoked pork jowl was so veined with glistening deposits of fat that we pushed it away after a few bites, and the consensus among my guests was that the $100 clay-roasted \xe2\x80\x9cBeggar\xe2\x80\x99s Duck\xe2\x80\x9d worked \xc2\xadbetter as a piece of performance art (it\xe2\x80\x99s cracked open at the table) than as a meal. So save your banquet dollars instead for the \xc2\xadtender salt-and-pepper-encrusted lamb-rib tips (served on the bone with a pot of kefir cr\xc3\xa8me fra\xc3\xaeche), or Bowien\xe2\x80\x99s opulent smoked prime rib (the rib chop is garnished with king-crab legs and drizzled with clarified butter), or \xe2\x80\x9cJosefina\xe2\x80\x99s House Special Chicken,\xe2\x80\x9d which is stuffed Filipino style with a savory crumble of chorizo-spiced pork sausage, green olives, and boiled eggs, then hoisted to the table with proper ceremony on a giant silver tray.\n\nAward Links\n\n\nBest Bacon: Mission Chinese Food (10/03/13)\n\n\nFeature Links\n\n\nAdam Platt\xe2\x80\x99s Where to Eat 2013 (30/12/12)\n\n\nhttp://www.mcfny.com/\n\n\n\n\nHours\n\nMon, 5:30pm-11pm\nTue-Fri, 5:30pm-midnight\nSat, 11am-3pm and 5:30pm-midnight\nSun, 11am-3pm and 5:30pm-11pm\n\n\n\nPrices\n\n$9-$35\n\n\n\nPayment\n\nAmerican Express\nDiscover\nMasterCard\nVisa\n\n\n\nSpecial Features\n\nBar Scene\nDine at the Bar\nNotable Chef\nTake-Out\nBrunch - Weekend\nHot Spot\nPrivate Dining/Party Space\nOnline Reservation\n\n\n\nAlcohol\n\nFull Bar\n\n\n\nReservations\nRecommended\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvg.
