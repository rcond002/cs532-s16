He has four goals in his last three outings\xc2\xa0dating back to his brace in a 6-1 World Cup qualifying victory over St. Vincent and the Grenadines in November of last year, sending the US into their upcoming qualifier\xc2\xa0home-and-away series with Guatemala (March 25 and 29) with their first winning streak since the Gold Cup in July 2015. \xc2\xa0\nIt was far from the action-packed showcase\xc2\xa0from the USMNT\xe2\x80\x99s first outing\xc2\xa0of their now-completed January camp. The Canadians\xe2\x80\x99 conservative approach in their first match of 2016 made\xc2\xa0for a cagey affair as US head coach Jurgen Klinsmann juggled his lineup, going with a more experienced group \xe2\x80\x93 minus debutant San Jose Earthquakes goalkeeper David Bingham.\nCanada also debuted a goalkeeper, giving Montreal Impact youngster Maxime Crepeau his first national-team start, along with former Philadelphia Union defender Steven Vitoria in central defense.\nThe US controlled the pace from the outset, but despite seven shots before halftime (three on goal), Canada\xe2\x80\x99s press was effective in limiting the danger.\nThe Yanks\xe2\x80\x99 best chances before halftime came when Altidore nearly opened the scoring in the 17th minute, firing off the post.\xc2\xa0Gyasi Zardes and Jordan Morris combined in the box at the 21st-minute mark. But Morris\xe2\x80\x99 flick to Zardes on the back post resulted in a tough angle and shot out of bounds.\nMichael Bradley then teed up a left-footed shot from distance in the 39th minute, but Froese was in the right spot and dealt with it nicely.\nThe US continued to push in the second half with marginal results. In the 66th minute, Altidore went up between two defenders to meet a cross from second-half substitute Jerome Kiesewetter, in a harbinger of things to come, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t put his header on frame.\nThe US outshot Canada 16-6 for the match, and the Yanks finally got just due in the 89th minute when Altidore again rose between two defenders in front of goal to head home a perfect cross from second-half substitute Ethan Finlay on the left flank.\nVitoria had a chance to equalize in stoppage time, but his shot from the center of the box on a cross from Kyle Bekker sailed high. Canada finished with no shots on goal. It spoiled a solid defensive effort from the Canadians in their only warm up before facing Mexico in two World Cup qualifiers (March 25 and 29).\xc2\xa0\nThe US are now unbeaten in their last 17 matches against Canada.\nConnection Lost.
