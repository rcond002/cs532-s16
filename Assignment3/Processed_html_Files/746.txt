They will first roll out to Office Insider participants, and later to consumer and commercial Office 365 subscribers. If you have an Office 365 subscription, make sure you have the latest version of Office.\n\nReal Time Presence\nCollaboration is getting better and better in PowerPoint 2016 for Windows. When you share your presentation with others using OneDrive or Office 365 SharePoint, you can work together in real time. You can now not only see when others are working on the same shared presentation as you, but also see an indicator that shows you exactly what slides they\'re working on, and where in the slides they\'re working. To learn more about real time co-authoring, see Collaborate on PowerPoint presentations with real time co-authoring. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk Annotation\nOn touch-enabled devices, you\'ll now see a Draw tab on the ribbon in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint where you can select inking styles and start making ink annotations directly in your files. In PowerPoint, you can also convert your ink drawings to Shapes by selecting them and then selecting Convert to Shapes. That way, you get the freedom of freeform drawing with the uniformity and standardization of Office graphic shapes. To learn more about inking in Office, see Draw and annotate with ink in Office 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\nBlack Theme\nThe highest-contrast Office theme yet has arrived. To change your Office theme, go to File &gt; Account, and then click the drop down menu next to Office Theme. The theme you choose will be applied across all your Office apps. To learn more about Office themes, see Change the look and feel of Office 2016 for Windows with Office themes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNovember 2015\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following features are only available to Office 365 subscribers. They will first roll out to Office Insider participants, and later to consumer and commercial Office 365 subscribers. If you have an Office 365 subscription, make sure you have the latest version of Office.\n\nMorph Transition\nPowerPoint 2016 comes with a brand-new transition type, Morph, that can help you make smooth animations, transitions, and object movements across the slides in your presentation. To use the morph transition effectively, you\'ll need to have two slides with at least one object in common\xe2\x80\x94the easiest way is to duplicate the slide and then move the object on the second slide to a different place, or copy and paste the object from one slide and add it to the next. Then, with the second slide selected, go to Transitions &gt; Morph to see how morph can automatically animate, move, and emphasize your objects across slides.\n\n\n\n\n\nPowerPoint Designer\nPowerPoint Designer is a new service that lets you take your content and automatically generate a variety of ideas that you can choose from to make your slides look better. When you add a photo or other unique visual content, the Designer pane will open automatically with a variety of suggested visual treatments you can choose to apply to your slides. Try adding a photo to a title slide to give it a try.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeptember 2015\nBoth Office 365 subscribers and Office 2016 one-time purchasers get the following new features.\n\nDo things quickly with Tell Me\n\r\n            You\'ll notice a text box on the ribbon in PowerPoint 2016 that says Tell me what you want to do. This is a text field where you can enter words and phrases related to what you want to do next and quickly get to features you want to use or actions you want to perform. You can also choose to get help related to what you\'re looking for, or perform a Smart Lookup on the term you entered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSix new chart types\nVisualizations are critical to effective data analysis as well as compelling storytelling. In PowerPoint 2016, we\'ve added six new charts\xe2\x80\x94with the same rich formatting options that you are familiar with\xe2\x80\x94to help you create some of the most commonly used data visualizations of financial or hierarchal information or for revealing statistical properties in your data.\nWhen you go to Insert &gt; Chart on the ribbon, you\'ll now notice five new options that are especially well-suited for data visualization: Box and Whisker, Treemap, Sunburst, Histogram, (and within Histogram options, Pareto), and Waterfall.\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights into what you\'re working on\nThe Insights pane, powered by Bing, offers more than just definitions. When you select a word or phrase, right-click it, and choose Smart Lookup, the insights pane will open with definitions, Wiki articles, and top related searches from the web.  You can also get to Smart Lookup any time by going to Review &gt; Smart Lookup and entering a query there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk Equations\nIncluding math equations has gotten much easier. Now, you can go to Insert &gt; Equation &gt; Ink Equation, any time you want to include a complex math equation in your presentation. If you have a touch device, you can use your finger or a touch stylus to write math equations by hand, and PowerPoint will convert it to text. (If you don\'t have a touch device, you can use a mouse to write, too). You can also erase and select and correct what you\'ve written as you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreen recording\nPerfect for demonstrations, you can now include screen recordings in your PowerPoint presentations with just a few clicks. Just set up whatever you\'d like to record on your screen, then go to Insert &gt; Screen recording, and you\'ll be able to select a portion of your screen to record, capture what you need, and insert it directly into your presentation in one seamless process.\n\n\n\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature is also available in PowerPoint 2013 if you have the most recent updates.\n\n\nSimpler sharing\nChoose the Share tab on the ribbon to share your presentation with others on SharePoint, OneDrive, or OneDrive for Business.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter conflict resolution\nNow, when you\'re collaborating with others on a presentation and there are conflicts between changes you\'ve made and changes others have made, you\'ll see a side-by-side comparison of the slides with conflicting changes, so you can easily choose visually between which changes you\'d like to keep.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved version history\nNow you can go to File &gt; History to see a complete list of changes that have been made to your presentation and access earlier versions. \n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature is only supported for files stored on OneDrive for Business or SharePoint.\n\n\nColorful, Dark Gray, and White Office  Themes\nThere are now four Office themes that you can apply to PowerPoint: Colorful, Dark Gray, Black, and White. To access these themes, go to File &gt; Account, and then click the drop down menu next to Office Theme.\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter video resolution\nNow, when you export your presentation as a video, you can choose to create a file with resolution as high as 1920 x 1080, which is great for presentations on larger screens.\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature is also available in PowerPoint 2013 if you have the most recent updates.\n\n\nImproved Smart Guides\nSmart Guides no longer turn off when you insert a table. Now you can use them to make sure everything, tables included, is aligned properly on your slides.\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature is also available in PowerPoint 2013 if you have the most recent updates.\n\n\nQuick Shape Formatting\nThis feature increases the number of default shape styles by introducing new \xe2\x80\x9cpreset\xe2\x80\x9d styles with theme colors to quickly get the look you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies To: PowerPoint 2016\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\xef\xbb\xbf\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nHow can we improve it?\n255 characters remaining\n\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include contact information in your feedback.
