Thompson jokes he forgot Warriors existed, was Lakers fan as a kid\nFor Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, his young love for the Los Angeles Lakers was so strong that it blinded him to the existence of his future employer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGary A.Vasquez / USA TODAY Sports\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSep 25, 2015 at 3:07p ET\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0Shares\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\'s absolutely no guarantee that a child who grows up to be an NBA player will play for the childhood team of his dreams. And for Golden State Warriors guard Klay Thompson, his young love for the Los Angeles Lakers was so strong that it blinded him to the existence of his future employer.\n\n\nThompson was on hand to make a donation to the KIPP Bridge Charter School in Oakland on Friday, and he told the kids that he "was kind of a Laker fan growing up," which seems like an understatement when you see his follow-up comment:\n\n\n\ntrue\n\nKlay Thompson: "I was kind of a Laker fan growing up. But that changed quick."\xe2\x80\x94 Diamond Leung (@diamond83)\nSeptember 25, 2015\n\n\n\n\nKlay Thompson said Warriors weren\'t very good when he grew up and thought as college prospect, "Oh, I forgot there was a team in Oakland."\xe2\x80\x94 Diamond Leung (@diamond83)\nSeptember 25, 2015\n\n\n\n\n\nBut can you really blame him? One, he was a kid. Two, his dad, Mychal Thompson, was a championship-winning player for the Lakers. Three, he was born in Los Angeles and went to high school in southern California. Four, as Thompson said, the Warriors weren\'t very good when he was growing up.\n\n\n\n\nBut to say that you forgot the Warriors even existed in Oakland? That joke might hit a little close to home with the team set to move across the bay in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\nMORE NEWS: \nWant stories delivered to you?
