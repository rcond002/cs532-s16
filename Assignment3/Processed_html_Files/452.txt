The two teams would go into half deadlocked at 0-0.\nAfter the break, Fanendo\xc2\xa0Adi found himself in prime position in the 54th\xc2\xa0minute to all but seal Portland\xe2\x80\x99s trip to either Columbus or New York next weekend. After working the right flank, Diego Valeri found Adi alone in front of the net with Dallas defender Walker Zimmerman on the ground. Adi was able to fire the ball off of Jesse Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s right foot, ricocheting into the net for 1-0 lead. Zimmerman was making only his third start since mid-June in place of Zach Loyd.\n\nFULL BOXSCORE AND CHALKBOARD\n\nDallas would not give up, however. After being on the defensive often in the first half, defender Ryan Hollingshead found the back of the net in the 69th\xc2\xa0minute. Argentine midfielder Mauro Diaz took a pass from Je-Vaughn Watson at the top of the Portland box and found Hollingshead streaking down the left flank. Hollingshead drilled the ball to the opposite corner, squeaking it inside the left post to draw even at 1-1.\nJust four minutes later in the 72nd\xc2\xa0minute, Diaz was able to thread another high-arcing pass, this time off a free kick. The ball found the head of a charging Blas Perez, who substituted into the game in the 66th\xc2\xa0minute, and he put it past Adam Kwarasey to give Dallas a 2-1 lead and a hope of forcing extra time.\n\nCHECK OUT STATS FROM DAL-POR\n\nBut the two quick goals in a four minute span was all Dallas was able to muster, as Portland hung tough through the final 20 minutes. Dallas threw out all the stops, including subbing in Michel for Hollingshead in the 86th\xc2\xa0minute to attempt to capitalize on set piece opportunities.\nForward Lucas Melano was able to add a cushion goal in stoppage time after the furious Dallas rally, leaving\xc2\xa0the score level at 2-2.\nThey will await the winner of Columbus Crew SC and the New York Red Bulls for their opponent in the MLS Cup next week (4 pm ET; ESPN/UniM\xc3\xa1s in US; TSN/RDS in Canada).\nConnection Lost.
