Referees for all MLS games will be trained, assigned and evaluated by PRO (Professional Referee Organization).GAME CLOCKThe official game time for all Major League Soccer games will be managed on the field by the referee. If necessary, the referee may also allot extra time (a.k.a. "stoppage time\xe2\x80\x9d) at the end of each period (first half, second half, and if applicable, first overtime period and second overtime period during playoff matches) to allow for injuries, time-wasting or other disturbances.The stadium clock will display the time from 0:00 to 45:00 and from 45:00 to 90:00 (plus stoppage time where applicable in each half). For statistical purposes, the minutes for goals, substitutions, yellow cards, etc., will be listed from the first minute until the 90th minute. A goal scored at 15 minutes 10 seconds will be listed as having been scored in the 16th minute. Events occurring during stoppage time will follow the international norm by being demarcated with a "+" sign and the extra minutes. For example, a goal scored three minutes into first half stoppage time will be officially identified as happening at "45 + 3".GAME DAY ROSTERSEach team can nominate 18 players for a game day roster. Teams are allowed three substitutions per game.CAUTIONS AND SUSPENSIONSA player will be suspended for one game upon receiving his fifth yellow card \xe2\x80\x93 regardless of the nature of the infraction that resulted in his being awarded a yellow card. A second suspension of one game would result after the awarding of an additional three cards, as would a third suspension after the awarding of card number eleven. When one yellow card away from being suspended for caution accumulation, if a player appears in three consecutive games without receiving a yellow card or disciplinary sanction, the player will have one yellow card expunged. A player may take advantage of the \xe2\x80\x9cGood Behavior\xe2\x80\x9d incentive only once throughout the season.\xc2\xa0MLS REGULAR SEASON MATCH POSTPONEMENT POLICYMatches may be postponed when circumstances exist such that continuation of play would pose a threat to the safety of participants or spectators.Postponement PolicyIn the event a match is abandoned in or after the 76th minute (i.e. 75:00 on the official game clock), the result and all statistics will stand.In the event a match is abandoned prior to the 76th minute, it will be postponed, rather than cancelled.

This is different from the regular season.i.If a player earns a yellow card in the Knockout Round match and then two (2) yellow cards in the Conference Semifinal Leg 2, that player would be suspended for the Conference Championship Leg 1 due to the red card/second caution but would remain on one (1) yellow card for his accumulation total. If the player\xe2\x80\x99s Club does not advance in the MLS Cup Playoffs, the red card suspension will carry over to the 2016 MLS regular season.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A player who earns a straight red card in the same match in which he previously has earned his second cumulative yellow card MAY BE SUSPENDED for his next two (2) MLS Cup Playoff matches.(1) For example, if a player earns a yellow card in the Knockout Round match. He then earns a yellow card (his second cumulatively) in the Conference Semifinal, Leg 2 AND a straight red card (different from earning a second yellow card) in the same match. The player IS SUSPENDED for the Conference Championship, Leg 1 (due to the red card) AND IS SUSPENDED for the Conference Championship Leg 2 (due to playoff yellow card accumulation).(2) However, if a player earns a yellow card in the Conference Semifinal Leg 2 and then earns both a yellow card (his second cumulatively) in the Conference Championship Leg 1 AND a straight red card in the same match, then the player IS SUSPENDED for the Conference Championship Leg 2 (due to the red card) but IS NOT SUSPENDED for MLS Cup as the yellow card accumulation re-sets entering MLS Cup.\xc2\xa0D.\xc2\xa0A player who earns a red card in any MLS Cup Playoff match, whether a straight red card or two (2) yellow cards, IS SUSPENDED for his next match (if this occurs in MLS Cup, then the suspension carries over to the first regular season match of 2016).\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0A player sanctioned by the Disciplinary Committee will have any corresponding suspension applied to the next match(es) for which he is eligible including any MLS Cup Playoff match(es), MLS Cup or the 2016 MLS regular season.\xc2\xa0 MLS CUP PLAYOFFS: MATCH DELAY\xc2\xa0PROCESS\xc2\xa0Each MLS Cup Playoff match will be played in its entirety.
