If you\'re wondering how to Tweet with your location, please see our Adding your location to a Tweet article.\nWhat location information is attached to my Tweets?\n\nEnabling location services allows you to selectively add location information to your Tweets. This feature is off by default and you will need to opt in to use it.\nOnce you\'ve enabled location services, you will be able to attach a location (such as a city or neighborhood) of your choice to your Tweet. Simply tap the location marker while composing your Tweet, and select the location you wish to tag.\xc2\xa0Note:\xc2\xa0Once you Tweet with a location, your next Tweet will automatically include a general location label. Learn how to turn location off at any time\xc2\xa0here.\xc2\xa0\nIf you choose to toggle on the "Share precise location" button (available on Twitter for iOS version 6.26 or later, and on Twitter for Android version 5.55 or later), your precise location (latitude and longitude) will be associated with your Tweet and findable via API.\xc2\xa0\nIf you Tweet using an earlier version of Twitter for iOS or Twitter or Android, every Tweet you geotag will include your device\'s precise location (latitude and longitude) which can be found via API.\xc2\xa0\nThird-party applications or websites may let you Tweet with location, including your precise location. We ask these developers to clearly explain what information is being shared when you use their products to Tweet with location.\xc2\xa0\n\nWhat controls do I have when I attach location information to my Tweets?\nEven after you enable Tweeting with your location, you have additional control over which Tweets (and what type of location information) is shared. With this in mind:\n\nTweet location is off by default, and as a user you need to opt in to the service.\nYou can turn Tweet location on or off at any time.\xc2\xa0\nYou can delete all of your past location data from displaying in your Tweets in a single place (see this article for step-by-step instructions).\nBe cautious and careful about the amount of information you share online. There may be some updates where you want to share your location ("The parade is starting now" or "A truck just spilled delicious candy all over the roadway!"), and some updates where you want to keep your location private. Just like you might not want to Tweet your home address, please be cautious when Tweeting from locations that you don\'t want others to see.\n\nRemember that when you\'re opted into Tweet location, location suggestions may be offered to you, but you can still choose not to share your location for individual Tweets (see this article for instructions).\nPlease familiarize yourself with our general location settings and the settings of any applications and devices you Tweet with so that you are always aware of the information you share.\nRemember, once you post something online, it\xe2\x80\x99s out there for others to see.\n\nWhat location information is displayed?\n\nAll geolocation information begins as a location (latitude and longitude), sent from your browser or device. Twitter won\'t show any location information unless you\'ve opted in to the feature, and have allowed your device or browser to transmit your coordinates to us.\nIf you have chosen to attach location information to your Tweets, your selected location label is displayed underneath the text of the Tweet.\nOn twitter.com, you can select a location label such as the name of a neighborhood or city.\nIf you tap the location marker while composing your Tweet and toggle on the option to tag your precise location, that Tweet will include both the location label of your choice and your device\'s precise location (latitude and longitude), which can be found via API. Your precise location may be more specific than the location label you select. Note: the option to share your precise location is currently available only on newer versions of Twitter for iOS (6.26 or later) and on newer versions of Twitter for Android (version 5.55 or later).\xc2\xa0\nIf you Tweet using an earlier version of Twitter for iOS or Twitter for Android, each Tweet you geotag will include both a location label (this will display alongside your Tweet) and your device\'s precise location (findable via API).\xc2\xa0\nApplication developers are required to be up-front and obvious about whether your exact coordinates, or just the place, will be included in your Tweet. When you Tweet from a third-party application or mobile device, it should be clear which type of data will be included in your Tweet.\xc2\xa0\n\nHaving trouble?\nOur Account Settings troubleshooting section has answers to common issues.\nNote: In some areas, you have the option to label your Tweet with a specific business, landmark, or point of interest. These places are sourced from Foursquare. If you see an issue with a place, please report it via Foursquare\xe2\x80\x99s Help Center. If you believe that a specific Tweet is abusive, please report it to Twitter by following the instructions here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Was this article helpful?\n        \n\n\nYes\nNo\nSubmitting...\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTweet\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnglishEnglishFran\xc3\xa7aisItalianoDeutschEspa\xc3\xb1ol\xe6\x97\xa5\xe6\x9c\xac\xe8\xaa\x9ePortugu\xc3\xaas\xed\x95\x9c\xea\xb5\xad\xec\x96\xb4\xd0\xa0\xd1\x83\xd1\x81\xd1\x81\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9NederlandsBahasa Indonesia\xe0\xa4\xb9\xe0\xa4\xbf\xe0\xa4\xa8\xe0\xa5\x8d\xe0\xa4\xa6\xe0\xa5\x80Bahasa MelayuFilipino\xe7\xae\x80\xe4\xbd\x93\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87\xe6\xad\xa3\xe9\xab\x94\xe4\xb8\xad\xe6\x96\x87T\xc3\xbcrk\xc3\xa7eNorskDanskSuomiSvenskaPolskiMagyar\xd8\xa7\xd9\x84\xd8\xb9\xd8\xb1\xd8\xa8\xd9\x8a\xd8\xa9\xd9\x81\xd8\xa7\xd8\xb1\xd8\xb3\xdb\x8c\xe0\xb8\xa0\xe0\xb8\xb2\xe0\xb8\xa9\xe0\xb8\xb2\xe0\xb9\x84\xe0\xb8\x97\xe0\xb8\xa2\xd7\xa2\xd7\x91\xd7\xa8\xd7\x99\xd7\xaa\xe0\xa6\xac\xe0\xa6\xbe\xe0\xa6\x82\xe0\xa6\xb2\xe0\xa6\xbe\xc4\x8ce\xc5\xa1tinaLimba rom\xc3\xa2n\xc4\x83\xd0\xa3\xd0\xba\xd1\x80\xd0\xb0\xd1\x97\xd0\xbd\xd1\x81\xd1\x8c\xd0\xba\xd0\xb8\xd0\xb9Ti\xe1\xba\xbfng Vi\xe1\xbb\x87t\n\n\nTwitter Properties Links\n\n\nAbout\n\n\nCompany\n\n\nBlog\n\n\nHelp\n\n\nStatus\n\n\nJobs\n\n\nTerms\n\n\nPrivacy\n\n\nCookies\n\n\nAds Info\n\n\nBrand\n\n\nAdvertise\n\n\nBusinesses\n\n\nMedia\n\n\nDevelopers\n\n\n\n\n    \xc2\xa9 2016 Twitter, Inc.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'
