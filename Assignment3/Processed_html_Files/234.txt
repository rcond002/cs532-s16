Of all the great Batman runs that have helped to define the character, the six issues that Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers spent on Detective Comics back in 1978 stand out as one of the all-time greatest. It\'s intricately crafted, beautifully drawn, and while Englehart\'s claim that it more-or-less invented the Batman of the Modern Age might seem a little overblown at first glance, it\'s hard to argue that it\'s not at least a major part of the foundation of how the Caped Crusader would evolve over the following decade. As for just what makes it so great and why it stands the test of time, it all comes down to how they were able to build on the past while creating something that still feels modern almost 40 years later.\nRead More\n\n\n\nFiled Under: Batman, MARSHALL ROGERS, STEVE ENGLEHART, Strange Apparitions Category: Ask Chris, DC, Opinion, Reviews\n\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\n\xe2\x80\x98Agent Carter\xe2\x80\x99 Post-Show Analysis, Season 2, Episode 5: \xe2\x80\x98The Atomic Job\xe2\x80\x99\n\nby CA Post-Show Team\n2 hours ago  \n\n\n\n\nWith Agents of SHIELD taking a much-needed winter break, Marvel\xe2\x80\x99s other spy adventure series, Agent Carter, is back for a two-month engagement, with Hayley Atwell reprising her role as Peggy.

There have been statues and replicas galore, but few actual action figures from DC\'s in-house collectibles team have been of the cinematic oeuvre. With the DC Cinematic Universe kicking into high gear this year, it\'s time for the DC Films Premium line to make its debut.\nThe first figures for the line will include a mash-up of Man of Steel and Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice characters, all set to arrive in September. Armored Batman and Superman will represent BVS, with Zod, Faora and Jor-El coming from MoS. Now, I know there probably weren\'t too many people banging at the gates, begging for more Russel Crowe Jor-El figures, but at least his Kryptonian armor makes him a bit more interesting than any potential Kevin Costner Pa Kent would ever be. That\'s not a big factor in Jor-El\'s favor, but the guy\'s gotta take pluses where he can.\nRead More\n\n\n\nFiled Under: Batman, Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, DC Collectibles, Faora, harley quinn, jor-el, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, superman, wonder woman, Zod Category: DC, Movies, Toys\n\n\n\n\nEMAIL\n\n\nSHARE\n\n\nTWEET\n\n\n\nPoll: Who Should Be Riverdale\xe2\x80\x99s One True Power Couple?\n\nby Chris Sims\nYesterday  \n\n\n\n\nValentine\'s Day is just around the corner, so naturally, our thoughts have turned to comics\' most infamous hotbed of love triangles: Riverdale, USA!

That\'s it. That\'s the news. We can wrap it up. I could talk about the rest of the new DC Icons announced by DC Collectibles today (via IGN), but then I wouldn\'t be able to get in my car to drive to Los Angeles and grab this figure from the production room while all of the DC Collectibles employees are at Toy Fair this weekend. I consider myself a patient man, but I can\'t wait until November for this.\nBatgirl was just one of six new figures announced for the Icons line, as well as two accessory packs to add even more Easter egg mayhem to these figures. Technically I guess you would count Grail as a seventh figure even though she\'s part of a two-pack with Darkseid, but you get what I\'m saying.
