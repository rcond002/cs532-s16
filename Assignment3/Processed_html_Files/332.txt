"We were in a similar situation for the first match against Antigua &amp; Barbuda in June, and we will be prepared.\n\xe2\x80\x9cFabian has been ill since the weekend, and we were waiting to see if he would be healthy enough to join us in Miami.

A change\r\nof scenery, a return home, some self improvement and a supportive Sounders\r\nstaff have brought him back to the place where his career took off \xe2\x80\x93 the U.S.\r\nNational Team.\n\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m 28\r\nyears old now,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson said.\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a lot more mature.

Johnson\'s status for next Tuesday\'s home game at Livestrong Sporting Park against Guatemala is also in question because of the flu.\nThe report makes it seem as if Johnson is not currently training with the U.S. in Miami, stating that he could join them this weekend if he recovers from the flu. U.S. Soccer did not respond to the validity of that in an immediate inquiry.\nIf Johnson is out, he would join Landon Donovan and Brek Shea as players called into this camp that will be unavailable for the final two games of this round of qualifying. It would also leave head coach Jurgen Klinsmann with one less option to deploy out wide, which might force him to call in some replacements.\nJermaine Jones has also arrived in camp carrying an injury.\nWhat do you make of this development? Is it time for Klinsmann to summon some replacements? Who would you like to see Klinsmann turn to if Johnson can\'t play?\nShare your thoughts below.\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\tPosted by Franco Panizo at  4:15 PM\r\n\t\r\n\t\tin Americans Abroad, U.S. Men\'s National Team\n|\nPermalink\n\n|\nComments (152)\n\n|\nTrackBack (0)\n\n\n\nTechnorati Tags:\r\n\t\t\tJohnson\'s flu adds to mounting USMNT woes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSBI Men\'s College Soccer Top 25 (Oct. 10th)\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\r\n\nIf anyone still had questions about Marquette\'s legitimacy as a national power this year, those questions were answered over the weekend, when the Golden Panthers toppled unbeaten UConn, the No. 1 team in the SBI College Soccer Top 25 at the time.\nMarquette handed the Huskies their first loss of the season to not only maintain one of only two perfect records in the nation (Cornell holding the other), it also cemented Marquette\'s status as a serious contender for the Big East title and a potential NCAA run later this year.\nOut West, we saw UCSB, UCLA and New Mexico all suffer defeats, with Washington and Cal-State Northridge benefiting from the upsets to secure their own places in the latest SBI Top 25.\xc2\xa0\nThe biggest mover in the new rankings is VCU, which debuts at No. 20 after a 4-1 mauling of Charlotte.

ROMERO\nColorado Rapids goalkeeper Matt Pickens will see his 75-match appearance streak end due to a groin injury that will force him out of the club\'s final two matches. \nPickens had the longest active streak in MLS before getting injured in Saturday\'s game against San Jose. He was replaced in the 69th minute by Stew Ceus. \nRapids coach Oscar Pareja said he doesn\'t expect Pickens to play any more this season and will go with Ceus or Ian Joyce in goal the rest of the way for the Rapids, who are out of playoff contention. \nPickens, 30, has a career high 107 saves this season. He also has the record for most consecutive matches played in Rapids\' history. \xc2\xa0\nHere are some more soccer stories making the rounds:\xc2\xa0\n\n\n\nContinue reading "Mid-day Ticker: Rapids\' Pickens out for the season; Fellaini sidelined; and more" \xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\tPosted by Jose Romero at  2:24 PM\r\n\t\r\n\t\tin European Soccer, International Soccer, Major League Soccer, MLS- Colorado Rapids, MLS- Real Salt Lake, MLS- Seattle Sounders, World Cup Qualifying\n|\nPermalink\n\n|\nComments (10)\n\n|\nTrackBack (0)\n\n\n\nTechnorati Tags:\r\n\t\t\tMid-day Ticker: Rapids\' Pickens out for the season; Fellaini sidelined; and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSBI MLS Best XI (Week 31)\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was a good week in MLS for playoff-bound forwards.\xc2\xa0\nFabian Espindola, Sherjill MacDonald and Chris Wondolowski are all key figures on teams heading into the MLS playoffs, and all three showed they are ready for post-season glory as they each turned in outstanding performances over the weekend.\nEspindola, MacDonald and Wondolowski all scored multiple goals to lead their teams to important victories, and all three earned SBI MLS Best XI honors in the process.\nFC Dallas is still trying to make the playoffs, and while their chances are slim at this point, the only reason they have any chance at all is the heroics of goalkeeper Kevin Hartman, who made several key saves to help Dallas salvage a point against Chivas USA.\nEddie Gaven did his part to help the Columbus Crew keep their playoff hopes alive, scoring a vital late equalizer to earn the Crew a precious point against Sporting Kansas City.\nFor the second straight week we had so many outstanding performances by forwards that some very deserving candidates fell just short of the Best XI. This week, Philadelphia\'s Jack McInerney barely missed the cut, while Seattle\'s Fredy Montero was also a worthy option who came up just short.\nHere is the rest of the SBI MLS Best XI for Week 31:\n\n\n\nContinue reading "SBI MLS Best XI (Week 31)" \xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\tPosted by Soccer By Ives at  1:10 PM\r\n\t\r\n\t\tin SBI MLS Best XI\n|\nPermalink\n\n|\nComments (9)\n\n|\nTrackBack (0)\n\n\n\nTechnorati Tags:\r\n\t\t\tSBI MLS Best XI (Week 31)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter repeated snubs, Klinsmann didn\'t bother calling Chandler this time around\n\n\n\n\n\nPhoto by ISIphotos.com\nBy FRANCO PANIZO\nAfter repeated attempts to call him into the U.S. Men\'s National team this year, only to be turned down on more than one occasion, It appears U.S. head coach Jurgen Klinsmann has grown tired of Timmy Chandler\'s unwillingness to commit to the U.S. national team.\nChandler\'s absence from this month\'s U.S. roster is not because the fullback denied a call-up, but rather because Klinsmann did not offer him an invitation, sources at Chandler\'s club team, Nuremberg, told SBI on Wednesday.\nChandler told SBI last month that he was open to receiving a call-up and getting cap-tied to the United States during the October qualifiers, but Klinsmann apparently did not deem it necessary to select the 22-year-old fullback.\n\n\n\nContinue reading "After repeated snubs, Klinsmann didn\'t bother calling Chandler this time around" \xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\tPosted by Franco Panizo at 11:52 AM\r\n\t\r\n\t\tin Americans Abroad, U.S. Men\'s National Team\n|\nPermalink\n\n|\nComments (166)\n\n|\nTrackBack (0)\n\n\n\nTechnorati Tags:\r\n\t\t\tAfter repeated snubs, Klinsmann didn\'t bother calling Chandler this time around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Soccer Rewind: Northwestern upends Notre Dame; Maryland edges Rutgers; and more\n\n\n\n\xc2\xa0\r\n\nThe Big East Conference is widely-regarded as the strongest men\'s soccer conference in the nation this year, but Northwestern scored a big one for the Big Ten on Tuesday night by knocking off Notre Dame in the evening\'s only battle of teams ranked in the SBI Top 25.\nFirst-half goals by Joey Calistri and Lepe Setane helped the No. 19 Wildcats knock off the No. 9 Fighting Irish, 2-0, in Evanston, Illinois.\nThe victory, which should help Northwestern move up in the new SBI Top 25, which will be released later today, improves the Wildcats\' record to 8-2-2 while the loss drops Notre Dame to 10-3.\nIn other action on Tuesday night, No. 1 UConn rebounded from their first loss of the season to beat Iona, while likely new No. 1 Maryland rallied from an early deficit to knock off Rutgers. No. 24 Cornell posted another impressive victory to remain one of only two teams in the nation with a perfect record. The other perfect team, Marquette, edged Northern Illinois, 1-0.\nHere is a rundown of all of Tuesday\'s top scores, as well as a look back at results from the weekend in men\'s college soccer.\n\n\n\nContinue reading "College Soccer Rewind: Northwestern upends Notre Dame; Maryland edges Rutgers; and more" \xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\tPosted by Soccer By Ives at 11:07 AM\r\n\t\r\n\t\tin College Soccer\n|\nPermalink\n\n|\nComments (4)\n\n|\nTrackBack (0)\n\n\n\nTechnorati Tags:\r\n\t\t\tCollege Soccer Rewind: Northwestern upends Notre Dame; Maryland edges Rutgers; and more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOlder\n\xc2\xbb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout\n\n\n\nCategories\n\n\n2011 Women\'s World Cup\nAbout SBI\nAmericans Abroad\nAmericans Abroad Spotlight\nBREAKING NEWS\nCanadian Soccer\nClassic Must-See Goals\nCollege Soccer\nCollege Spotlight\nCONCACAF\nCONCACAF Champions League\nCONCACAF Gold Cup\nCONCACAF OLYMPIC QUALIFYING\nConfederations Cup\nEuro 2012\nEuropean Soccer\nFantasy Soccer\nFIFA\nFIFA World Cup\nGaming\nInternational Soccer\nKickTV\nMajor League Soccer\nMatch Highlights\nMexican Soccer\nMLS All-Star Game\nMLS Combine 2012\nMLS Cup\nMLS Draft 2009\nMLS Draft 2010\nMLS Draft 2011\nMLS Draft 2012\nMLS Playoffs\nMLS Spotlight\nMLS Training Camp\nMLS Transfer News\nMLS Weekly Awards\nMLS- Chicago Fire\nMLS- Chivas USA\nMLS- Colorado Rapids\nMLS- Columbus Crew\nMLS- DC United\nMLS- Expansion\nMLS- FC Dallas\nMLS- Houston Dynamo\nMLS- Los Angeles Galaxy\nMLS- Montreal Impact\nMLS- New England Revolution\nMLS- New York Red Bulls\nMLS- Philadelphia Union\nMLS- Portland Timbers\nMLS- Real Salt Lake\nMLS- San Jose Earthquakes\nMLS- Seattle Sounders\nMLS- Sporting Kansas City\nMLS- Toronto FC\nMLS- Vancouver Whitecaps\nMLS: A Look Back\nMonday Morning Centerback\nMust-See Goals\nMust-See Videos\nNASL\nNational Soccer Hall of Fame\nNew Jersey Soccer News\nOlympic Soccer\nPodcasts\nRecommended Reading\nSBI 23 for 2010\nSBI European Club Top 25\nSBI Friday Free Kicks\nSBI Live Q&amp;A;\nSBI Match Day Commentary\nSBI MLS Awards\nSBI MLS Best XI\nSBI MLS Best XI of the Month\nSBI MLS Goal of the Week\nSBI MLS Player of the Month\nSBI MLS Player of the Week\nSBI MLS Power Rankings\nSBI MLS Rookie of the Month\nSBI MLS Rookie of the Week\nSBI MLS Save of the Week\nSBI MLS Spotlight\nSBI MLS Team of the Month\nSBI MLS Team of the Week\nSBI Questions\nSBI Reader Poll\nSBI Stoppage Time\nSBI Ticket Contest\nSBI Video Corner\nSBI Watch Party\nSoccer Legends\nSoccer on TV\nSouth American Soccer\nSpecial1TV\nU.S. Men\'s National Team\nU.S. Men\'s Olympic Team\nU.S. Open Cup\nU.S. Soccer\nU.S. Under-20 National Team\nU.S. Women\'s National Team\nU.S. Youth National Teams\nUEFA Champions League\nUnder-17 World Cup\nUnder-20 World Cup\nUSA Youth Soccer\nUSL Pro\nUSMNT Daily Update\nWomen\'s Soccer\nWorld Cup 2010\nWorld Cup 2014\nWorld Cup Qualifying\nWorld Football Challenge\nYou Write the Caption\nYour Running Commentary\nYouTube Soccer Clips\n\n\n\n\n\nArchives\n\n\nOctober 2012\nSeptember 2012\nAugust 2012\nJuly 2012\nJune 2012\nMay 2012\nApril 2012\nMarch 2012\nFebruary 2012\nJanuary 2012\n\nMore...\n\n\n\n\nMy Other Accounts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to this blog\'s feed\n\n\n\n\n\nBlog powered by TypePad\n\tMember since 10/2007\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\');\n// -->\n\n\n\n_qoptions = { tags:"typepad.core" }; _qacct="p-fcYWUmj5YbYKM"; quantserve();\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndocument.write(unescape("%3Cscript src=\'" + (document.location.protocol == "https:" ?
