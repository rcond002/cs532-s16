In 1996, the Galaxy earned eight straight wins in regulation to start the season before earning a shootout win over New England and extending that streak to 12-0 to start the season.\n**MLS News - March 27, 2012**\nThis Week in MLS - East makes a Comeback\n**MLS News - March 20, 2012**\nThis Week in MLS - Five hit Home this Week\n**MLS News - March 15, 2012**\nGame Guides now available for Week 2.
