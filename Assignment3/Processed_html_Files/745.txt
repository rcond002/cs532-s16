Here are some of the top new and improved features for Excel 2016.\n\n\nJanuary 2016 Updates\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following features are only available to Office 365 subscribers. They will first roll out to Office Insider participants, and later to consumer and commercial Office 365 subscribers. If you have an Office 365 subscription, make sure you have the latest version of Office.\n\nFunnel charts\nFunnel charts show values across multiple stages in a process. Typically, the values decrease gradually, allowing the bars to resemble a funnel. Read more about funnel charts here.\n\n\n\n\n\nImproved autocomplete\nExcel autocomplete isn\'t as picky as it was before. For example, let\'s say you want to use the  NETWORKDAYS function, but you can\'t remember how it is spelled. If you just type =DAYS, the autocomplete menu will bring back all of the functions that contain "DAYS," including, NETWORKDAYS. (Before, you had to spell the function name exactly.) \n\n\nTEXTJOIN\nThis function combines text from multiple ranges, and each item is separated by a delimiter that you specify. Learn more about TEXTJOIN here.\n\n\nCONCAT\n This new function is like CONCATENATE, but better. First of all: it\'s shorter and easier to type. But it also supports range references in addition to cell references.  Learn more here.\n\n\nIFS\n Tired of typing complicated, nested IF functions? The IFS function is the solution. With this function, conditions are tested in the order that you specify. If passed, the result is returned. You can also specify an else "catch all" if none of the conditions are met. Learn about IFS here.\n\n\nSWITCH\n This function evaluates an expression against a list of values in order, and returns the first matching result. If no results match, the "else" is returned. \r\nDetails and examples are spelled out here.\n\n\nMAXIFS\n This function returns the largest number in a range, that meets a single or multiple criteria. More information available here.\n\n\nMINIFS\nThis function is similar to MAXIFS, but it returns the smallest number in a range, that meets a single or multiple criteria. Read more about the MINIFS function.\n\n\n\nSeptember 2015\nUnless otherwise specified, both Office 365 subscribers and Office 2016 one-time purchasers get the following new features.\n\nSix new chart types\nVisualizations are critical to effective data analysis as well as compelling storytelling. In Excel 2016, we\'ve added six new charts\xe2\x80\x94with the same rich formatting options that you are familiar with\xe2\x80\x94to help you create some of the most commonly used data visualizations of financial or hierarchal information or for revealing statistical properties in your data.\nClick Insert Hierarchy Chart on the Insert tab to use the Treemap or Sunburst chart, click Insert Waterfall or Stock Chart for Waterfall, or click Insert Statistical Chart for Histogram, Pareto, or Box and Whisker.\n\n\n\nOr  click Recommended Charts &gt; All Charts to see all the new charts.\n\n\n\n\n\nGet and transform (Query)\nBefore analysis can begin, you must be able to bring in the data relevant to the business question you are trying to answer. Excel 2016 now comes with built-in functionality that brings ease and speed to getting and transforming your data\xe2\x80\x94allowing you to find and bring all the data you need into one place. These new capabilities, previously only available as a separate add-in called Power Query, can be found natively within Excel. Access them from the Get &amp; Transform group on the Data tab.\n\n\n\nOne click forecasting\nIn previous versions of Excel, only linear forecasting had been available. In Excel 2016, the FORECAST function has been extended to allow forecasting based on Exponential Smoothing (such as, FORECAST.ETS() \xe2\x80\xa6). This functionality is also available as a new one-click forecasting button. On the Data tab, click the Forecast Sheet button to quickly create a forecast visualization of your data series. From the wizard, you can also find options to adjust common forecast parameters, like seasonality, which is automatically detected by default and confidence intervals.\n\n\n\n3D Maps\nOur popular 3D geospatial visualization tool, Power Map, has been renamed and is now available to all Excel 2016 customers and is built into Excel. This innovative set of storytelling capabilities has been renamed 3D Maps and can be found along with other visualization tools by clicking 3D Map on the  Insert tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial templates\nTake advantage of \tthe new  My Cashflow template, and the Stock Analysis template. These templates track what  you earn, how much you spend, and where your spending occurs. Plus, quickly analyze and compare the performance of selected stocks over time.\n\n\nCalendar Insights Template\n\nView your calendar as a dashboard and drill into the data. You\'ll get a better handle on how you spend your time, and identify ways to get more out of your days.\n\n\nPivotTable enhancements\nExcel is known for its flexible and powerful analysis experiences, through the familiar PivotTable authoring environment. With Excel 2010 and Excel 2013, this experience was significantly enhanced with the introduction of Power Pivot and the Data Model, bringing the ability to easily build sophisticated models across your data, augment them with measures and KPIs, and then calculate over millions of rows with high speed. Here are some of the enhancements we made in Excel 2016,  so that you can focus less on managing your data and more on uncovering the insights that matter.\r\n\n\n\n\nAutomatic relationship detection\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 discovers and creates relationships among the tables used for your workbook\xe2\x80\x99s data model, so you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to. Excel 2016 knows when your analysis requires two or more tables to be linked together and notifies you. With one click, it does the work to build the relationships, so you can take advantage of them immediately.\n\n\n\nCreating, editing and deleting custom measures\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 can now be done directly from the PivotTable fields list, saving you a lot of time when you need to add additional calculations for your analysis.\n\n\n\nAutomatic time grouping\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 helps you to use your time-related fields (year, quarter, month) in your PivotTable more powerfully, by auto-detecting and grouping them on your behalf. Once grouped together, simply drag the group to your PivotTable in one action and immediately begin your analysis across the different levels of time with drill-down capabilities.\n\nPivotChart drill-down buttons\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 allow you to zoom in and out across groupings of time and other hierarchical structures within your data.\n\n\n\nSearch in the PivotTable\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 field list helps you get to the fields that are important to you across your entire data set.\n\n\n\nSmart rename\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 gives you the ability to rename tables and columns in your workbook\xe2\x80\x99s data model. With each change, Excel 2016 automatically updates any related tables and calculations across your workbook, including all worksheets and DAX formulas.\n\n\n\nMultiple usability improvements\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 have also been made. For example, delayed updating allows you to perform multiple changes in Power Pivot without the need to wait until each is propagated across the workbook. The changes will be propagated at one time, once the Power Pivot window is closed.\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-select slicer\nNow you can select multiple items in an Excel slicer on a touch device. This is a change from prior versions of Excel where only one item in a slicer could be selected at a time using touch input. You can enter Slicer multi-select mode by using the new button located in the Slicer\xe2\x80\x99s label.\r\n\n\n\n\nPublish and share your analysis with Power BI\nA report is not complete without being able to share it with the right people. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re finished preparing your data analysis, you can share it with your workgroup or clients through Power BI with just one button. Once published to Power BI, use your data models to quickly construct interactive reports and dashboards. With Excel Online support built into Power BI service, you can also display your fully formatted Excel worksheets as well.\n\n\n\nQuick Shape Formatting\nThis feature increases the number of default shape styles by introducing new \xe2\x80\x9cpreset\xe2\x80\x9d styles in Excel. \n\n\n\n\n\nInsert pictures with the correct orientation\nWith automatic image rotation, once you insert an image into Excel, it automatically rotates the picture to match the camera\xe2\x80\x99s orientation. You can manually rotate the image to any position after insertion. Note that this only affects newly inserted images and does not apply to pictures in existing documents. \n\n\nDo things quickly with Tell Me\n\r\n            You\'ll notice a text box on the ribbon in Excel 2016 that says Tell me what you want to do. This is a text field where you can enter words and phrases related to what you want to do next and quickly get to features you want to use or actions you want to perform. You can also choose to get help related to what you\'re looking for, or perform a Smart Lookup on the term you entered. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsights into what you\'re working on\nThe Insights pane, powered by Bing, offers more than just definitions. When you select a word or phrase, right-click it, and choose Smart Lookup, the insights pane will open with definitions, Wiki articles, and top related searches from the web.  You can also get to Smart Lookup any time by going to Review &gt; Smart Lookup and entering a query there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInk Equations\nIncluding math equations has gotten much easier. Now, you can go to Insert &gt; Equation &gt; Ink Equation, any time you want to include a complex math equation in your workbook. If you have a touch device, you can use your finger or a touch stylus to write math equations by hand, and Excel will convert it to text. (If you don\'t have a touch device, you can use a mouse to write, too). You can also erase and select and correct what you\'ve written as you go.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimpler sharing\nChoose Share on the ribbon to share your spreadsheet with others on SharePoint, OneDrive, or OneDrive for Business.\nThese changes bring together two key aspects of collaboration: who has access to a given document and who is currently working with you on the document. Now you can view both pieces of information in one place from the Share dialog box. \n\n\n\nImproved version history\nNow you can go to File &gt; History to see a complete list of changes that have been made to your workbook and access earlier versions. \n\n\n\n Note \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This feature is only supported for files stored on OneDrive for Business or SharePoint.\n\n\nNew themes\n\n\n\nThere are now three Office themes that you can apply : Colorful, Dark Gray, and White. To access these themes, go to File &gt; Options &gt; General, and then click the drop down menu next to Office Theme.\n\n\nData Loss Protection (DLP) in Excel\nData Loss Protection (DLP) is a high-value enterprise feature that is well loved in Outlook. We are introducing DLP in Excel to enable real time scan of content based on a set of predefined policies for the most common sensitive data types (e.g., credit card number, social security number, and US bank account number). This capability will also enable the synchronization of DLP policies from Office 365 in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint, and provide organizations with unified policies across content stored in Exchange, SharePoint and OneDrive for Business. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee Also\n\nWhat\'s New and Improved in Office 2016\n\n\nOffice 2016 Quick Start Guides\n\n\nAvailable chart types in Office 2016 for Windows\n\n\nCreate a forecast in Excel 2016 for Windows\n\n\nGet started with 3D Maps\n\n\nGetting Started with Get &amp; Transform in Excel 2016\n\n\nDo things quickly with Tell Me\n\n\nGet insights into what you\'re working on with Smart Lookup\n\n\nShare your Excel 2016 workbook with others\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApplies To: Excel 2016\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\t\r\n\xef\xbb\xbf\r\n\n\n\n\n\nWas this information helpful?\n\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\nHow can we improve it?\n255 characters remaining\n\n\nTo protect your privacy, please do not include contact information in your feedback.
