Steve Birnbaum&amp;apos;s header in the 90th minute \xe2\x80\x93 his first international strike \xe2\x80\x93 which came off a Michael Bradley free kick, sealed the win.\nMichael Orozco and Jozy Altidore, the latter of whom was outstanding on the day,\xc2\xa0also scored for the US. MLSers\xc2\xa0Ethan Finlay and Kellyn Acosta earned their first caps as starters, later joined by Crew SC&amp;apos;s\xc2\xa0Tony Tchani and VfB Stuttgart&amp;apos;s\xc2\xa0Jerome Kiesewetter as debutants. New England Revolution No. 10 Lee Nguyen earned his first start (7 caps).\n\nIt was a night of firsts for a handful of MLS players on the #USMNT. https://t.co/25FpDVK4eu\r\n\xe2\x80\x94 Major League Soccer (@MLS) January 31, 2016\nFormer Columbus Crew SC midfielder Kristinn Steind\xc3\xb3rsson opened the scoring in the 13th minute, when Matt Besler&amp;apos;s clearance popped up and Steind\xc3\xb3rsson&amp;apos;s shot deflected off Orozco; US goalkeeper Luis Robles had committed to a right-side dive to intercept the original trajectory, and the ball brushed back to his left.\nYet the US needed only 7 minutes to equalize with a well-coordinated attack. Jermaine Jones, at the midfield circle, began dribbling upfield while directing traffic. He spotted Gyasi Zardes to his left, and a quick pass was redirected back toward center, with Bradley collecting and slipping a lead pass between two defenders as Altidore raced around one to the spot for the conversion.\nThe second half opened with Iceland taking advantage of some US confusion after quick-playing an awarded free kick in the 48th minute. A few passes opened up a clear lane for Aron Sigurdarson, who fired a rocket into the upper 90 at the far post, with little chance for Robles to deflect.\nYet again the Yanks wasted little time in responding. After Altidore earned a free kick on the left wing, his shot was deflected over the back line. The first corner came up empty, but a subsequent attempt was headed out to Altidore, again on the left wing. He chipped the ball across the box, where it\xc2\xa0found Birnbaum&amp;apos;s head on the right side. The D.C. United defender \xe2\x80\x93 in retrospect, portending bigger things to come \xe2\x80\x93 directed the ball to Orozco across the goalmouth, where he sent it into the back of the net for a second equalizer.\nConnection Lost.
